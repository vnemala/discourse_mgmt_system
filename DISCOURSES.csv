1,Sevavrinda Translated Discourse 1,"This morning Bhagawan is with us seated in the chair in a ochre robe and I repeat as He says.
Don’t be proud of your youth and your wealth; in one moment all this goes. You should understand that all this is transient – Jagat mithya, Brahma sathya – and give importance to that what is eternal. So Adi Shankara said. At a very young age, he studied the Vedas and understood their inner meaning; thereafter, he taught the world that no grammar or scholarship protects us on our death-bed and so, we should keep chanting the name of the Lord, Bhaja Govindam.
One day Shankaracharya was walking with his disciples. There he saw a farmer walking pulling along a cow. Shankaracharya asked his disciples whether they thought the farmer was attached to the cow or the cow was attached to the farmer. Who owns the cow? It belongs to the farmer. Because the farmer feels he owns the cow, he was taking care of all its needs including feeding it.  Hence, the disciples said that it is the cow that is attached to the farmer. “Oh, is it so?!” Shankara exclaimed and walked on.  He took a knife and cut the rope. Till then the cow had been walking behind the farmer. Now the freed cow started running and the farmer began chasing it. Then Shankara said, “See it is not the cow that is attached to the farmer; it is the farmer that is attached to the cow.” So it is with this prapancha, world too. Very often many think they are bound by this world. But the truth is that they are holding on to the world. When the hand is full of worldly things, how can he hold on to Paramatma, God? Man’s mind too is filled with worldly thoughts; how can spirituality enter there? In a tumbler, there can be either air or water. If the mind is full of worldly thoughts, there is no place for spiritual thoughts. Similarly, if there are spiritual thoughts, there is no place for worldly thoughts. If you walk eastwards, the west fades into a distance. If you walk westwards, you get distanced from the east. So also, as you come nearer to God, you get distanced from the world. And the closer you are to the world, the further you are from God. 
What is prapancha? What is Paramatma? One day, Krishna called Dharmaraja i.e. Yudhishtira and Duryodhana. He told Dharmaraja to find a bad person and bring him to Krishna. And at the same time he told Duryodhana to look for a good person and bring him. Both left and returned after some time. Neither of them brought anyone. Each one went alone and returned alone. When asked, Dharmaraja said that he had searched the whole world and had not been able to find a single bad person. And Duryodhana said that he had searched far and wide and had not found a single good person. What does this really mean? The world is the same and yet Duryodhana could not find a single good person. And in the same world, Dharmaraja could not find a single bad person. So, as is our vision, so does Creation appear to us. If we have a spiritual vision, then the entire world appears divine. But when we have a worldly vision, then even God seems worldly.
At Brindavan, the gopikas were playing with Krishna. All the gopikas were jealous of Radhika with whom Krishna spent a lot of time. Knowing this, Krishna performed a leela-drama. He called all of them and danced the rasa leela with them. When the rasa leela was going on, he made each one feel that he was dancing with them. They all enjoyed great bliss. After the rasa leela, they were all returning home. They started conversing with each other. As you know, women can’t keep silent. They keep talking. One gopika said that all night Krishna had been dancing only with her and that her heart was overflowing with joy. Another gopika chided her and said that she must be lying for Krishna had been dancing with her! Then the third one joined in. Both of you are lying; Krishna was dancing only with me! And so, once again jealousy and hate crept in. Then Krishna thought either way these gopikas are jealous and that it was best that he go to Mathura! And so he went from Brindavan to Mathura. Everyone was in tears. Unable to bear his absence, they all came to Radhika. Radhika always seemed to be happy. Seeing her thus, they were all surprised. They asked her how it was that she could be happy irrespective of whether Krishna was with her, or with them, or even now when he had gone away. Then Radhika asked them, “Which Krishna are you referring to? Is it the Krishna who was born in and grew up in Brindavan? That is only the physical form of Krishna. That form has gone from Brindavan to Mathura. But the Krishna who is the atma is always installed in my heart. I was never dependent on his form. That is why I was happy when he was here and I am still happy when he has gone away. I am dependent not on the physical Krishna but on the indwelling Krishna. The entire universe is full of Krishna. Where is he not there? I can see him in every corner of Brindavan. I have no sorrow of any kind. Even after he has left, I see him everywhere and am full of joy. Only that illusion of the physical form has gone; knowing that I remain ever happy. To one whose vision is coloured by Krishna, the whole Creation is full of Krishna. Only those who are ignorant and selfish see the separation. Only they say that Krishna belongs here and does not belong there. Jealousy then gives rise to hatred and other painful feelings.”
 It is not right to say that God is here and not there. I don’t come from anywhere, I don’t go anywhere. I am always installed in your hearts as your atma. Like a wealthy person who has forgotten something precious he owns, you have forgotten what is inside you. God is not anywhere else-he is inside you. But in order to know that you should not be dependent on the external world. You should know the indwelling Paramatma. All that lies outside is a mere shadow. The real object is inside you. If you follow the shadow, you will get nothing. But you should know the object. Then the object and the shadow will both merge into one. So this prapancha is just a shadow. But only God is the real object. So we should depend only on the object and not on the shadow. When you obtain the object, you will obtain the shadow also. 
Man is thirty for happiness and is always looking for it. Even our students after having a hearty meal and a good nap say they have enjoyed brahmanandam. That is the only ananda they have understood. Thus everybody is looking for happiness; no one does anything to be unhappy. But worldly happiness can be lost in a moment. It is transient, unstable. For that kind of a happiness you struggle which comes and leaves in a moment. You think that if you have this or that, you can be happy. But when you get something, you desire something else. And so on. There is no limit to the desires you can have in this world. If a vessel has holes, however much water you may pour into it, you can never fill it. Desires are like the vessel with holes. Whatever you pour drains away. You keep pouring, it keeps emptying. In this manner you can never understand Paramatmananda, the bliss of Paramatma. We should know and experience the bliss that lies within us. 
As there is a shortage of water in Muddenahalli, many were suffering. They had been spending lacs of rupees and buying water in tankers to meet the water requirement. But they did not know that a river flows here. A lot of money was spent in getting water from here and there. Finally, after knowing that we have a good source of water here, a well was dug and water obtained. After finding this source, there is no need to buy tankers from outside. Once we taste the divinity within us, we will not look for happiness in the external world. We have to dig the borewell where there is water. There is no use digging where there is no water. Within our heart is the flow of bliss. We have to understand this bliss that lies within us. We should not go and seek happiness from the outside world; we become beggars. The method to know this is to go inside, go inside. If at hundred feet we don’t find it, we have to dig to two hundred feet. If we don’t find it at two hundred feet, we should go to five hundred feet. For that water is only inside us. Only if we go deep, deep, deep within can we find it – we cannot get it if we remain superficial. I always say that if you see a photograph of chapathi or if we hold a discussion about chapathis or describe it; our hunger will not be appeased. The only solution is that you have to take a small piece of chapathi, eat it and digest it. However much we may talk about God, it is of no use. That is only superficial, not real.  When we understand the Paramatma who is inside us then that will be with is forever. How is that possible?
Paropakarartham idam shareeram. Our body has been given to us to help others. This body has not been given to us for fulfilling our desires. Deham devalayam. Body is the temple of God. Jeevo deva sanathana. Only those who believe that will make the right use of the body and enjoy bliss. You should look after the body – there is nothing wrong in that. It is a temple. Not just God, the temple too should be looked after well. But only when we do acts that bring it credit does it become bhakthi. You have to remember that this body is the temple when doing seva. Look after your own health first.
 Shraddha – abiding love for God and faith- alone is not enough; shakthi –strenth- and saamarthyam –capability - too are necessary. Only when all three are there can we do real seva. Yesterday I said that this refers to head, heart and hand. When you are young, the hands are strong. At that stage it is possible to do seva with shraddha, shakthi and saamarthyam. As you age, the hands get weaker. At that stage, you can still guide the youth with shraddha and saamarthyam. Since the youth have physical strength, they can do physical work; as the elders don’t have physical strength, they can guide the youth. You have experience. When your experience and their effort come together, there will be success. But often after retirement, along with physical strength, mental strength too reduces. You become forgetful. Even then you can still do seva with your shraddha. You can talk to everyone with love, look after everyone with love and after thinking through pros and cons, you should respond to everyone. We should do seva according to the situation. 
In Seva Vrinda too we should give seva depending on each one’s shraddha, capability and age. You should not give tasks that need much physical strength to the elderly. What is suited to them, you should give them that. Similarly, youth should not do seva sitting in one place. They should use all their strength and capability and do seva. The elders are not doing and so why should we do anything- youngsters should not think in this manner. They are doing what is suitable for them; you do what is suitable for you. Leaders should also think through and allot suitable tasks. Seva for men, for women, for elders, for youngsters – you should analyse and then allot. You should also look at capability – some are good with computers, some are good at music or drama. Doctors can participate in medical camps. Engineers can help in building things. As different people have different natures, they have different capabilities too. You should consider their capabilities and give tasks that fit their capabilities. Students here are singing so soulfully; it fills everyone’s hearts. But if you ask these singing students to go and cook, no one can eat what they make. Similarly, if you ask cooks to do bhajan, then both the meal and the bhajan will be ruined. No one can then be happy. So whatever each one’s regular work is, such tasks should be allotted. Leaders should come together, analyse and then allot tasks according to capabilities. Quantity of work is not important; quality is. I am seeing everything. Some seva dals do work for an hour and write a report for four hours about the work they have done. 
One person came to do seva and wanted to give some donation. The donation given was Rs.50; he was garlanded with a Rs.100 garland. We don’t want that kind of seva. If the right hand does seva, the left should not know about it; if left does, right should not know. Seva done without ego and attachment is real seva. There is no need to say that I have done this, or that so and so has not done that. If I were outside you would have to tell Me; since I am inside I know everything, you don’t have to tell Me anything. Whatever seva you do reaches Me: I don’t need to repeat this. I know everything that you do – wherever you do, whatever you do. Don’t waste your time saying so and so did this or that. Use that time also to do seva. 
Seva is not only that which is done through the body. Our words, thoughts, actions – everything should be full of love. When does that love come? Everyone has great love for Swami. It is only when we have the feeling that Swami is in everyone that that feeling of love for all comes. A greeting made to anyone reaches God. Abusing anyone is abusing God. It is not necessary to go to Puttaparthi or Muddenahalli or anywhere. Serve everyone in your family and in your home. There are many husbands and wives. The husband wakes up early, wears white clothes and leaves for the medical camp. He returns tired late at night. As soon as he returns, he commands saying that he is very tired after doing so much seva, and that he wants a cup of coffee. After drinking his coffee, he does not even wash his cup. Through the day he did seva but now he makes is wife do seva. Then he calls his children and tells them that his hands and feet are aching and asks them to massage them. What he did is seva, what he is getting done is also seva. There is no use doing such seva. First we have to do seva in our homes. It is not right to say that certain tasks are to be done by women only. Neither is it right to say that certain tasks are to be done by men only. As the need is, so you should do seva. When parents do seva thus, then the children also learn. Just by telling they will not learn. But if you demonstrate, they will learn. So we should practise and then children will learn. First you serve your family. Husband, wife, children – all should come together in bhakthi and seva. When the family is in order, society will be in order too. When the society is in order, the nation will be in order too; when the nation is in order, the whole world will be in order too. First, set yourself right. Next pay attention to your family; then to the society, nation and the world. Then you become a real sevak. So first all of you must come together and think about setting right your own character first. 
It is not necessary that you should do seva only here in a place which carries Swam’s name. Lot of seva is going on in several organisations. If someone asks, you can go and serve there too. Don’t have the thought that this is separate from that.	  Only those who are ignorant have this feeling of difference and division. But Swami’s devotees are not only those who pray to Sai Baba. All forms are Mine. Don’t have a feeling of separateness. All are ours; have this feeling of expansion. When you think like that, the whole world will come together in unity. Many organisations – including those run by Christians, Sikhs, Muslims – do a lot of seva. The thought that we do seva but they don’t is what leads to feelings of separateness. Come together in unity and do seva. When we have such feelings of selfless love and do seva without any desires, then we can enjoy divine bliss. Our ego and attachment diminish and spirituality grows. That is the purpose of seva. Seva is not for recognition.
Many of you may know that we have a hospital in Raipur. Surgeries are performed on many poor children. Dr. Krishna Manohar, a famous surgeon, works there. When he was working at a hospital in Chennai, he heard about the Raipur hospital. He is not a devotee of Baba. He has never seen Sai Baba or sung bhajans about Him nor read books about Him. But he brought his entire team and came to Raipur; he came there and learnt about the hospital. What is not happening elsewhere is happening here. Children are being operated and treated very well here. What does not happen in Chennai or Mumbai or Delhi or in America is happening here. The instruments and equipment for cardiac surgeries on adults are different from those used for children. 	It is relatively easier to operate on adults; their hearts are larger. But in paediatric cases, the heart is the size of a one rupee coin. Imagine the complications in that small size. To operate that, you need great skill.  In India there are only two surgeons with such skill. Among them, Dr. Krishna Manohar is one. He and his team have sacrificed so much and come to Raipur. They have not come for Sai Baba; inspired by the work done by Sai Baba they have come. They tell everyone that they do not know who Sai Baba is, but now we know that the kind of work being done here could only be done by God. Even though I have worked elsewhere for thirty years, I have not got such success. The reason for this is not me. Because of the selfless love, God’s Grace has been bestowed here. Sai Baba Himself is performing the surgeries; it is not me. Then I called him and told him – two Operation Theatres they got ready so that on a single day they can perform four surgeries – the government will give you a big award. He fell at My feet and said that he does not want any award or reward; that will only increase my ego. When the children go back home smiling, that is enough for me. And when their parents are happy and the institution gets a good name that is good enough. If I can do good work for Swami that is enough for me. He was never a devotee, nor did he go to any samiti or become a member of the seva dal nor did he perform any kind of prayers, but when he performs this kind of seva, that is My worship. Work is Worship, Duty is God. When you work with such an attitude that is real seva. Building a hospital in Bengaluru or Puttaparthi is quite easy; but Raipur is a place that no one knows well. It is in central India, the heart of India: patients come from Bengal, Gujarat, Nepal, Delhi, Haryana etc. From east patients do not need to travel to south India- they are so poor that they cannot even afford train tickets. So it is difficult for them to come to Puttaparthi and Bengaluru. The food habits and language of people of north India is different from the south; so when they come to our hospitals in the south it is difficult for them. So we have built this hospital closer to them which is more convenient and suits them more. In the south, we give them idli, dosa, rava idli etc, but in the north, we give them chapathi, dal, rice etc. So seva should be according to the time, place and circumstances. We should understand the people whom we are trying to serve. While performing service, our head, heart and hands should all work together – we should analyse well and then act. ",3/19/2015,Service,
2,Sathyasai Vihara - Discourse to Alike staff members,"This afternoon, Bhagawan is seated amidst us in an ochre robe and I will repeat as He says.

The land of Bharat, the Motherland, has conceived many an eminent man whose fame has crossed countries and continents. This is the brave motherland which drove away the foreign invaders and attained independence. This is the divine land which has reached the zenith in the fields of music, literature and other sciences. This is the land which has made its mark in fine arts. Having been born in this land of Bharat, it is the duty of you teachers to protect and safeguard its secular and spiritual treasures.

The Vedas declare that one who practises is a teacher. Preaching without practising is not correct. It is through Nidarshanam or demonstration that we should educate children and not through Pradashana or exhibition. 

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa who was born in Bengal, was a great AvataraPurusha. On one occasion, a mother took her child to him saying, ""My son eats only sweets all the time and does not eat anything else. I tell him that it is bad for his teeth and stomach but he doesn't pay heed to my words. But hoping that he will listen at least when you tell him, I have brought him here."" Ramakrishna Paramahamsa asked, ""What should I tell your son?"" “Tell him not to eat sweets, for he will listen to your words"" said the mother. He said, ""Alright, bring him after a week."" So the mother went back thinking that he would perhaps think of a good plan during that time and tell after a week. When she came back after a week, Ramakrishna called them and told the boy, ""See Bangaru, you stop eating sweets from now. You can go now."" The mother was very surprised, ""If this is all that you wanted to tell, why is it that you are telling it now? Could you not have told it before?"" Ramakrishna Paramahamsa replied, ""Look mother, at that time even I used to eat a lot of sweets. Being born in Bengal, my tongue is very partial to sweets. From the past one week, I have not touched any sweets. Since I practised that, I now have the right to advise the same to the boy. I can only advise when I have the right to do so, otherwise it is not possible."" 

If it is preaching alone that we do, children are not going to learn anything by looking at us. They will think that we are acting as we wish and simply telling the children. Therefore when there is unity in our thoughts, words and deeds, children will also learn looking at us.  If we do Pradarshana or exhibition before the children, they too do only exhibition before us. They too will come fall at your feet, tell ""Sairam"" and act very respectfully. But later they will talk behind your back. 

At one point of time, I used to like paan or betel leaves very much. The devotees would also bring me paan. I would always be chewing paan. One day, I called a devotee for an interview. That devotee used to inhale snuff. Due to the irritation in his nose, he took out a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his nose in front of Swami. The kerchief had become very black. His tongue also used to be black. I told him, ""See, you are doing this kind of a thing. If others see this, what will they think about you?"" Then sorrowfully, he agreed to leave the habit. After some time, I went to the college. There I was speaking to the students about Adarsha or idealism. When I took out my kerchief and wiped my mouth with it, it had become red. Then I realised that I had told others but I Myself had not learnt this lesson. Therefore from then onwards, I stopped chewing paan. First I should be perfect, then I can tell the children. If I keep acting, then the children also will only keep acting in front of Me. When there is no unity in our thoughts, words and deeds, we will become Duratma. Such kind of teachers are not teachers at all. Only the one who practises is a teacher. Therefore truly when we practise alone can we think that we are teachers. All these kinds of worldly education, whether we teach them or not, they will any how learn it. Everyone will wish to pass the exam with good marks. But nobody will teach them Atmavidya or the education of the soul. Worldly education is related to the mind. If they lead their lives following the mind, they will be unable to follow Dharma and become Dharma Bhrashtas. This is because the mind will always ask for its selfish desires. It will always be thinking of 'I', 'me' and 'mine'. But the heart thinks about everybody. Only when we follow the Hrudaya Dharma or the Dharma of the heart will we become closer to God. Heart is selfless. Therefore, when they are taught HrudayaVidya, they will be able to learn Atmavidya. Selfless education is the true education. Worldly education is required, no doubt. But along with that spiritual education is very important. Spiritual education is the foundation. Worldly education is the building built on it. Foundation is not seen. But without it, the building will collapse. 

Today a lot of doctors had come. Medical education is very difficult. Everyone struggle hard and study. But a lot of students go into depression and get into the wrong path. Therefore all types of bad habits are found in medical colleges. Because of bad company, even good students are taking the wrong path. They keep quiet thinking that it is difficult to go in the right path when there is everyone else along with them. 

Duryodhana was a very powerful man. But because of his one negative quality of enmity or hatred, he lost everything. Hiranyakashipu was a very big scientist. Due to the negative quality of ego, he lost everything. Ravana was very well educated. But because of one negative quality of lust, he lost everything. Hiranyaksha was a great man. But due to the negative quality of greed, he too lost everything. Because of one negative quality, they all lost everything that they had. Is worldly education any less? There is nobody as well educated as Ravanasura. He was well versed in 64 types of knowledge. But because of the negative quality of lust, his whole family was destroyed. All these negative qualities- lust, anger, greed, attachment, ego, jealousy - are related to the mind. It is not correct to put the blame on the body. We are experiencing it through the body and not because of the body. Lust, anger, attachment and all these are related to the mind. When we cleanse our mind, we can learn the true education. Mind is the driver. Body is the car. Heart is the master. If the driver listens to the heart and drives, then we will the reach the right destination. But when we don't listen to the heart and instead listen to the mind, that is when accidents occur. The reason for all the wrong doings these days lies in the lack of Atmavidya. Without the distinction of men or women, everybody is getting harmed by those people. They treat both youngsters as well as elders with disrespect. Therefore for our children, mere worldly education is not enough. Along with that, we should also teach them character building education. What is this character? Doing whatever is right at all times, at all places and under all circumstances is character. When one follows this, it can be said that he has a good character. To build a good character, one needs courage. Because of the effects of the age of Kali, there are negative qualities everywhere but no positive qualities. In the company of negative people, it is very easy for us to become negative. It is very easy to fall down from the top. But it is very difficult to climb up from the bottom. Once we fall down, it is very difficult to climb up again. Therefore we should see to it that we do not fall down. It is only when we have Atmavidya that we do not fall down. When everyone is engaged in negative activities, it requires a lot of courage for us to be positive. To get that courage we should have faith. What is faith? Faith should be there in the good. Goodness is Dharma. That Dharma is divinity. Therefore when there is love for divinity, all this can happen. 

Daiva Preeti, Papa Bheeti, Sangha Neeti When all these three combine, we will behave cultured manner. You can teach the wordly knowldege of English, Maths and Science to children. But along with that we should also teach them the values of Daiva Preeti- love for God, Papa Bheeti-  fear of sin and Sangha Neeti- morality in society. They should have love for God and fear of sin. But it is not right to have love for sin and fear of God. The first and foremost thing that the teachers should do is to correct their own character. If there is dirty water in the tank, through the tap too will gush out only dirty water. Therefore if the children are not good, the fault lies in our hands. Teachers are the tank. Students are the tap. The water in the tank will only come out from the tap. If there is pure water in the tank, the tap will also give pure water. Therefore teachers should have unity in thoughts, words and deeds. I keep telling now and then that it is not the fault of the children, it is not the fault of the children. If children become bad, then the reason for that will be the parents or their teachers. If the children are good also that is the reason, parents and teachers. Parents, teachers and students should join together for their education. We should tell this to the parents also. Most of the students go behind marks to please their parents. Then think that they should score good marks, get a good job and earn a fat salary. As the money comes, the ego also starts developing. They forget the very parents for whose sake they had struggled hard and studied. Marrying whomever they like and leading their lives in this way, they treat their parents with disrespect. They are only struggling for the sake of their own selfish desires and not for the sake of others. We have got this body for the sake of serving others. God has given us this body to serve others. The body should not be ruined by heinous acts and bad conduct.

One who lacks education is equal to an animal. What kind of education? Atmavidya. Shankaracharya said that one who does not have Atmavidya is equal to an animal. Man has a body. His behaviour is similar to that of an animal. You will be reading the newspapers. The children are behaving in such a repugnant manner that it is not possible to talk about it. Animals at least have a reason and season but the children do not even have that. When everyone is doing wrong deeds, it requires a lot of courage if we have to do the right deed. It is only possible if we have love for God, fear of sin and morality in society. Otherwise it is not possible. Education ministers are spending crores of rupees and building new educational institutions. But without good teachers, all those institutions are useless. If a good teacher is there, he can teach sitting under a tree also. No matter how big the building, if there are no proper teachers then it is of no use. Therefore in our educational institutions, teachers are like our blood. They remove all the bad qualities from the students and put it in the institution. This institution is like the heart. Keeping all the bad to itself, it only sends the good outside. When children come, they will have a few faults. Merely by scolding them, it will not be corrected. Ours is like a repair shop or a work shop. We are all mechanics. Spoilt cars come to us and not new cars. We cannot complain that we only get spoilt cars. Because it is a repair shop. We should repair it, turn it into a good car and send it back. That is our Dharma. 

Teachers should have love in their hearts. When there is love, there is patience. If there is no love, there is no patience. Children may not remember all the good that we do to them but even one bad word if we speak to them, they will remember it throughout their lives. Therefore we should purify our characters. This is very easy. Just have unity in thought, word and deed. When you go outside and try to teach in other institutions, there will be many obstacles and challenges. Even if you want to teach a good lesson to the students, they will not be ready for it. Here we are educating them in a very good environment, in a Gurukula environment. You have to utilise that. We should help children develop respect for the institution even after they leave it. Whatever they learn here, they should go and teach to the world outside. Our objective should be Atmano Mokshartham Jagat Hitayacha. If we do not do good to the world, then our soul also will not get liberation. Therefore they should always be together. Along with worldly education, there should also be spiritual education. The goal of education should be to get a good character. End of education is character. If character is there, then everything else will follow. Will power, intelligence, all these will be there if there is character. Develop love for God. First and foremost, you should develop love for God. By looking at you they will learn. When we tell, they will understand. But when they see, it will remain in their memories. When we do, they will also learn. It is not enough if we tell them, we have to practise it ourselves and show them. 

This year too we will be organising a summer course in Muddenahalli. All the PU students and teachers can come and join. Sometimes, as we go on working, our battery will come down. Then a little charging is required. In such situations, all of us together should involve in discussion, reflection and then we must implement it. This itself is the charging. Everyone will have doubts, difficulties and problems. When you come and ask there, I will give the solutions to your problems. One more thing I have to tell you. If you look after my children, I look after your children. Then you will be able to be selfless. Therefore, let everyone work here to develop a good character by developing the broad-mindedness that all children are our children. If you have good character, becoming a doctor or engineer is very easy. If there is no character even if one becomes a big doctor, finally they will be in sorrow. Ravana, Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyaksha, Kamsa were all very clever and educated, but they were characterless. The reason for the bad state of the society today is the dearth of character. If we need character, then we should have courage. To get courage, we need faith. Faith is possible only by love for God, not otherwise. You have to teach them only Bhakti, everything else will happen on its own. I have come here with the objective of telling you all this and therefore I am telling you.

In the future, this institution will grow and in every district there will be an educational institution like this. You all tell the children to become engineers, doctors and lawyers but nobody asks them to become teachers. Our teachers also very proudly say that so many students have become doctors and engineers but nobody says that so many students have become teachers. Therefore you should provide the children with the required encouragement and enthusiasm to become teachers. That is a very ideal type of living. When you have respect towards your profession, they too will develop respect towards it. If you keep thinking that you are only a teacher and you should instead have been a doctor or an engineer, they too will start thinking like that. If we complain that we don't have money and wealth, they will also learn to do the same. But as a teacher, if you have the courage that you are serving the society, then the children will learn seeing that. Therefore the profession of teaching deserves a lot of respect. Hence it is said that the Guru is divine. Nobody says that doctor is divine or engineer is divine. Matru Devo Bhava, Pitru Devo Bhava, Acharya Devo Bhava. After mother and father, it is the teacher who is given that respect. Therefore, do this seva with a lot of joy, happiness and respect. Don't think of it as a work, think of it as seva or service. In the coming days, after discussing with the trustees, I will solve your problems and difficulties. Therefore you do your duty with joy and happiness. By looking at you, the children will also learn. All of you come for the summer course. There will be people coming here not just from Karnataka, but from all over India. You should not have the narrow-mindedness that this is Sathya Sai Institution and others are not. You should develop the broad-mindedness that everybody, all the institutions are ours and all children are ours. Hence during the summer course, not only our teachers, teachers from other institutions will also be coming. We can learn from them and then can also learn from us. Therefore along with eating together, we should also learn from each other. Sahanavavatu Sahanou Bhunaktu Saha Veeryam Karavavahai",3/22/2015,Education,
3,Sevavrinda Translated Discourse 2,"Swami is with us this morning seated in a white robe in the chair and I repeat as He says. 
If any one comes to Me even once and offers himself entirely to Me, then I grant him abhaya, freedom from fear. In the Bhagavad Gita too, Lord Krishna has said that if anyone thinks of me continuously, I will take care of all his needs. Swami, too, has been saying this to His devotees. There is never any destruction (naashaa) for My devotees. But, who is a devotee? By claiming that one is a devotee, one does not become a devotee. Only when God Himself calls someone a devotee can you call yourself a devotee. If we want to be true devotees of God, then what should we do? 
Bhakthi does not pertain only to prema, love. A mother because of her love for her child, works hard and prepares different kinds of food for the child. That love converts to seva, action and brings joy to the child. Whatever the child likes, she cooks and serves the child. Unlike in the olden days, children these days demand cakes on their birthdays. That is western culture, not Indian culture. In a village, a child once asked his mother for a cake on his birthday. But where are cakes available in a village? But the mother took great pains and made a cake and gave it to him. With the objective of making the child happy, the mother made the cake. So we not only need the attitude of prema and willingness to do seva but we also need saamarthya, the capability to do it. 
Many people write to me and say they would like to be My instruments. But to become My instruments you need to have three qualities. First, shraddha, which is the combination of a deep abiding love for God and steady faith. Shraddha is not enough; you need shakthi too. Shakthi is the ability to use the body to do seva. Is it meaningful for an elderly person to say that he will go to a village and do seva? If he goes to a village, he will possibly fall ill and will have to be served by the villagers. Thus, shraddha is not enough, shakthi too is essential. Such shakthi is there only when one is young. But during their youth, most people are busy nurturing their families and don’t participate in seva. They plan that they will do seva after retirement. After they retire, even though they have shraddha, they don’t have shakthi. So we should engage in seva when we are young and have physical strength. Only shraddha and shakthi are not enough, the necessary capability should also be there. Suppose you decide to do a narayana seva. You have shraddha and shakthi too. But if you don’t know how to cook then you don’t have the capability to do that seva. If you have capability but don’t have the shraddha or shakthi, then too, it is of little use. It is only when you have all three that you are a real devotee. 
Shraddha pertains to the heart; shakthi refers to hands; saamarthya is buddhi or head. When shakthi, buddhi and heart all come together, you can perform real seva. You can remember this as 3H- head, heart, and hand. Only heart is not enough; head and hands have to join it. At the age when we have all three, we should do seva. As one grows old, the mind and body become weaker; it is not possible to do seva then. At that time if you try to do seva, you become a burden to those whom you are trying to serve. 
King Dasharatha had grown old and was feeling sad that he did not have any children. He was distressed and praying because there was no one to continue his lineage. At that time Sage Vasishta told him that if he performed a yajna, sacrifice, then because of its fruits, he would have children. So Dasharatha arranged for all that was needed for the yajna. 
Who is this Dasharatha? Dasharatha represents five karmendriyas, organs of action and the five jnanendriyas, organs of perception.  Who are Dasharatha’s wives? Kausalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. They represent sattva guna, rajo guna and tamo guna. The indriyas are associated with the three gunas. This is true for all of us too. Vashishta, the guru, is the heart. What does the heart say? Everything should be offered to God – that is the yagna we have to perform. What is the fruit of such yajna? We get the nectar-like sweet pudding, payasam, of love. Love in action is dharma, righteousness. Love in feeling is shanthi, peace. Love in understanding is ahimsa, non-violence. Love in speech is sathya, truth. The payasam is not the gross object – it is not a thing, but is serving others    (paraartha). So when you eat this payasam, you will have four children – they are Sathya, Dharma, Shanthi and Ahimsa. Rama reprents Sathya; Bharata, Dharma; Shatrughna, Shanthi; Lakshmana, Ahimsa. Only when we beget these four children can we have the kingdom of heaven, Ramarajya. 
Ravana represents kama- desire. And he is the enemy of Rama. The message of the Ramayana is that we have to defeat Ravana and establish Ramarajya. If you think that the Ramayana is a mere story, then that it is not correct. What is taking place in our lives every day is Ramayana. 
Seetha represents Sahana, forbearance. Where there is truth, there will be forbearance. Seetha was born of Mother Earth. So she is called, Dharini. If we have a pure heart, we will also have truth, righteousness, peace, non-violence as well as forbearance. However, kama krodha lobha mada moha matsarya –desires, anger, greed, pride, delusion, envy- try and disturb this. That is what we have read in the Ramayana too. 
When we put our palms together and do namaskara, we bring together our five karmendriyas and five jnanendriyas and offer them to God. We have to offer all the three gunas in us – satva, rajo and tamo guna - to God. When we do perform such a yajna, then we obtain the payasam of prema. When we take the payasam of love, then we will have the four children – Sathya, Dharma, Shanthi and Ahimsa. Prema is the root of everything. Such love we should develop.			.
We should not celebrate Ramanavami merely as the day of Lord Rama’s birth. Rama is not outside us. He is inside us as Atma Rama. The day we understand the divinity within us that is the real Ramanavami. This is not chaturthi or ashtami; this is navami. For Ganesha, we celebrate Vinayaka chaturthi. For Krishna, Krishnashtami. For Rama, it is Ramanavami. What is this navami? When we practise the nine forms of bhakthi and surrender to the Lord, then we will have darshan of Atma Rama. To understand this spiritual significance, it is essential to surrender to the Lord. When someone surrenders completely to Lord Rama, then he grants freedom from all fear of this worldly existence, samsara. 
Vibheeshana is Ravana’s brother. Though he is a rakshasa by birth, he is a devotee by actions. Our life is determined not by the circumstances of our birth but by our actions. Unable to bear the injustices performed by Ravana, Vibheeshana left him and came to Lord Rama. There was a lot of debate and discussion then. Many did not trust him and thought that being from the enemy camp, he would create trouble for Lord Rama’s side. But Rama said that if any one comes and just once offers himself wholeheartedly to Rama, then and there Rama grants him abhaya, freedom from fear. 

What is this ‘abhaya’? Life is full of fear now. When one has body consciousness, then there is fear. Body is transient; it will perish some day. Body consciousness leads to fear. When we give up body consciousness and move towards soul consciousness then we become close to Atma Rama. That is the real Ramanavami day. 
So all of you too should offer all your actions to God and perform everything only for receiving His Love and Grace. When you do that, your body consciousness diminishes and your soul consciousness increases. Just gathering and singing Rama bhajans and listening to talks about Rama and eating prasadam offered to Rama does not make it Ramanavami. 
Rama is the embodiment of Dharma. We should walk along the path that Rama has shown and make our lives righteous. The only true bhakta of Rama is Hanuman. He was so immersed in devotion to Rama that his every hair chanted Rama’s name. How is that possible? He had no sense of I-ness.  Everywhere there is only Rama – that was his feeling. When the feeling of ‘I’ ness is there, ego is present and it is not possible to visualise the Self. If we want Sai, then the ‘I’ has to go. But this is not easy. To go from I to Sai, we have to pass the ‘We’ stage. When we do seva, we have to go from svaartha, selfishness to paraartha, doing good for others and from there to Paramatma, divinity. To do this we need shraddha, shakthi, saamarthya. Now when you are young, you are using all your faculties only to do service to yourselves – not to others. Start Early; Drive Slowly; Reach Safely.
 I am very happy that all of you have gathered here. But if you follow in your lives what you have heard today, then I will be even happier. This evening there is a program in the auditorium – there will be Rama bhajans and you will hear Rama’s story. Now it is time for lunch. Without eating, it is not possible to do bhajan. Bhajan may yet be possible; transformation is impossible. I am bringing My discourse to an end with blessings that all of you may walk on the path of righteousness that Rama demonstrated. After arathi, all of you may gather in the dining hall; I too will come there. Tomorrow you may come here and ask all your spiritual doubts. ",3/28/2015,Special_Occasion,Rama Navami
4,Ganesh Chaturthi Morning Discourse,"Aum Shri Sai Ram. I perceive Bhagawan seated in the chair in a white robe and I repeat as He speaks.
(Telugu lines)
God does not have either birth or death; He has no beginning, He has no end, He has no the middle part that is what is called life. One who is neither born, one who can never be killed – that is the Lord who pervades everything in the Universe. 
Embodiments of Divine Love,
Formless God comes down to the level of His devotees in the human form to their level so that they can understand Him. It is very difficult for the embodied human beings who have a human body to understand the formless aspect of God. Down the ages God has been descending in the human form; many times in many forms with many names. First and foremost, God who is formless put upon Himself three forms. God put upon Himself these three forms in order to do the three functions: the first is creation, the second is sustenance and third is destruction – annihilation. God became the creator, Brahma, when He did the function of creating the universe. Actually, the power of Brahma is Saraswati. All forms of education, all forms of knowledge and wisdom take the form of Saraswati. Stithi, or the second function, is management of the universe. God manifests Himself as Vishnu while doing this act of management and His Divine Consort is Lakshmi which is the power for sustenance. Another name for Lakshmi is Maya. Wherever there is Vishnu, there is the power of Vishnumaya. When He does the function of annihilation, He takes the form of Shiva though He is formless. The three things i.e. creation, sustenance and annihilation- they are the three functional aspects of God. All these three are like three departments – creation department, management department and destruction department. When you look at the world, you find many kinds of buildings being built. We need to construct buildings, maintain them and finally even the buildings become dilapidated - we destroy them. That is how the whole universe is managed by creation, sustenance and annihilation. That is how God first manifested Himself in three forms in order to do these three functions. Each department does not have only one head; you will have his secretaries, you will also have his administrators, he will also have his workers. Therefore, God has arranged for every function, every department, various Ganas or angels and demi-gods to look after various functions. If you look at a municipal corporation, you will find various departments like water department, electricity department, public works department etc. Therefore in this creation, we have various types of Gods like Varuna, Indra and others. 
An incident happened when Shiva and Shakthi resided on the Kailasha Mountain. And Shiva all the time in order to do his function will be going around the world. Shakthi being all alone at home, she felt lonely and wanted some company, therefore, she created Ganapathi out of the paste while she was bathing. Those days there did not have soaps or shampoos. Those days they used paste made out of various kinds of powders to make into soap like turmeric or dal, various powders were mixed to make into a fragrant paste to be used as soap. Out of that paste, Parvathi created the form of Ganapathi. She utilised her own power and gave life into that form. Because the shape attained life, it became the child of Parvathi. Thus when Parvathi was playing with her child, it so happened Ishwara came back home.  When Ishwara tried to enter into the home, this Ganapathi obstructed Him. And there was a fight between the two. In this fight finally, Shiva beheaded Ganapathi. Listening to the commotion outside  she also came outside. She started crying. “What a heinous job you have done! You have killed your own son.” When Parvathi was lamenting, Ishwara felt her pain and promised her that he would revive her son again. Even in these days, when there is a fight between husband and wife, ultimately it is the husband who surrenders. Even Shiva could not escape this kind of exercise. Shiva told his servants, “You go and see if there is anybody sleeping with his head towards the north; you cut off that your head and bring it here. I would transplant that head into this body of Ganapathy.” And when we went to Raipur to attend the medical conference, there a heart surgeon said that the first heart transplantation took place in India. And there are all kinds of transplantation taking place these days – heart transplantation or kidney transplantation- but the most difficult thing is the head transplantation. Because in the head is the brain. In brain also there are all kinds of nerves. There is a spinal cord also. Therefore, if you want to transplant a head with a brain, it is most difficult job. Shiva had lot of experience in head transplantation. And first when he had cut off the head of Prajapati, he put a goat head on the Prajapati. Therefore for Shiva it was not a very difficult job. By mere will of Ishwara, it happened. That is why the elders advise the youngsters that you should not sleep with your head towards the north. There is an important reason. The earth is like a magnet. There is the North Pole and the South Pole. Therefore, when you lie down in the north-south direction, the body will act like a magnet. When you put your head – which represents north- towards north, there is repulsion. All of you will know, the people who study science will know, that North Pole repels North Pole and attracts South Pole. Therefore, you should not keep your head towards north; you can keep your head towards south and sleep. When the servants went around looking for somebody sleeping with their head towards the north, the first they found was a baby elephant. Therefore Ishwara got that baby elephant head, granted salvation to that elephant and put this elephant head on Ganapathi. And thus, Ganesha became the elephant-headed God. Head is very important for any man. Depending on your head, you get the kind of food. When you want to salute somebody, the first thing you do is you bend your head. Therefore, head is an important limb of the body. When you want to respect somebody, you bend your head and offer your respect.  Ganapathi was like any ordinary boy when he had only human head. When the head was changed into the elephant head, the thoughts also changed. Elephant keeps eating too much of food. Therefore, this Ganesha also started eating lot of food. Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, repeat character; sow a character, reap destiny. Because of the elephantine thoughts that Ganesha entertained, his stomach also became like that of an elephant. That is why Ganesha loves food very much. When you want to worship Ganesha, you have to offer very delicious food like modaka, ladoos and other things that he likes. Once he had eaten lot of food; because of the heaviness of the stomach, he was not able to walk. Because he could not walk properly, he fell down. And Chandra saw that. Moon is a very beautiful god. If you look at anybody very beautiful, you say that the face is like that of the moon. Moon, looking at the ugly form of Ganesha, laughed at him. And Ganesha got angry, wanted to give a curse to the moon. According to mythology till that point of time there was no waxing and waning for the moon. Because of the anger and the curse of Ganesha, the moon started growing and diminishing in size. “You are very arrogant about your beauty; from now onwards you will diminish in your size, one day become completely extinct.” The moon felt very repentant, came down and fell at the feet of Ganesha and prayed for pardon, Then Ganesha said, “I can’t withdraw the curse completely. May be I can decrease the adverse effect of the curse.” Once your word slips out if your mouth, there is no way you can take it back. Therefore if you want to speak something, think ten times before you utter those words. Repenting after speaking is not good. Should always have forethought and not repentance. That is what is called discrimination. Through discrimination, we have to cultivate forethought and we should use and speak only the right kind of words at all times. Ganesha told moon only one day you will never be seen by anybody; but later on you will grow and you will keep on putting on size and finally you will become full. Thus you see every day moon is either growing or diminishing in size. Also Ganesha said that if anybody looks at the moon on the fourth day, he will have some adversity facing him. In the Bhadrapada maasa – the current month – on the fourth day if the moon is seen, it is going to lead one to many difficulties. And if you worship Lord Ganesha on that day and put the sacred rice on your head, then no curse will affect you. Even if you have by chance looked at the moon on this fourth day, if you worship God and adore Ganesha then this curse will not affect you.
 Our scriptures say that if you listen to the story of Shamantakamani also, you would be excused from the ill effects of having looked at the moon on the fourth day. Shamantakamani was a very rare gem. King Satrajit did penance to please the Sun God; finally, Sun God offered him this gem called Shamantaka. This Shamantaka also has the shine of the sun. What is more important is that this gem, Shamantaka, will give you every day eight kilograms of gold. Suppose you keep getting eight kilograms of gold every day, you can become very rich. Thus Satrajit, every day getting so much of gold, became a very rich king. That was the Dwapara Age. There was a relationship of Satrajit with Krishna. When there was great difficulty in the kingdom, Krishna told Satrajit, “Divine Grace has blessed you with so much of wealth and now so many people are in distress; better you share your wealth with everybody in the kingdom.” Satrajit thought that Krishna wanted to steal his gem, Shamantaka, and therefore he did not accept the request of Krishna. Why does God give so much of wealth to some people? The only purpose of God giving too much of wealth to some people is that wealthy people can share it with those who do not have wealth, thereby they will earn merit. And today if you find somebody who is poor, in some life he was rich. But this poor man who was wealthy in previous life, he has not shared his wealth with poor people in those times; therefore he becomes a poor man in this life. Our future depends on what we do today. Yad mati tad gati.  However your thoughts are, same way your future will be shaped. Satrajit because of his selfishness did not pay heed to Krishna’s word. Satrajit has a younger brother by name Prasenjit. One day this Prasenjit took this Shamantaka mani from Satrajit, put it on his neck and went for hunting into a forest. When he was fighting with a lion, lion killed him. The lion killed Prasenjit and took away Shamantakamani. When Satrajit saw that Prasenjit was not returning even after many days, he got a doubt in his mind. And that was the fourth day of the moon. On this fourth day of the moon when Krishna was partaking some payasam or pudding, he saw the reflection of the moon in the cup. And we also know that when we look at the moon on the fourth day of the moon in this particular month, it will bring you adverse results. Because Krishna did not do Ganesha pooja on that day, he had to face many difficulties. Satrajit started accusing Krishna saying, “You have killed my brother, Prasenjt, and stolen the Shamantakamani.”And Krishna in order to remove the stain of that accusation, he went to the forest in search of this gem. He saw Prasenjit’s corpse. But that gem was not there. He saw the footsteps of a lion; he followed the footsteps and he went into a cave. And when this lion was carrying this gem, there came a bear and there was a fight between them. And this bear was none other than Jambuvan; he took away the gem from the lion. Krishna went into the cave where Jambuvan lived, fought with him and got back the gem. Jambuvan who was a very powerful warrior recognised that Krishna was none other than Sri Rama come in the form of Krishna; he was very happy and offered his daughter, Jambuvathi, in marriage to Krishna. Krishna came back to the city with Jambavathi and also the gem. When Krishna offered the Shamantaka gem to Satrajit, Satrajit was also very happy and offered his daughter, Sathyabhama to Krishna. That is the story of Shamantakamani.
What is the use of listening to this story? It is very important to understand the inner meaning of this story. And if you win the grace and blessings of God, you will not face any kind of difficulties. Therefore on this birthday of Ganesha, if you worship him, adore him and win his grace – Ganesha is the first to be worshipped anywhere – therefore, offering worship to Ganesha is very meritorious. This worship starts on the Chauthi or the fourth day and ends on Chaturdasi or the fourteenth day. But within three days you can offer your worship, offer him food and offer him many kinds of activities and on the third day, you can do the immersion of Ganesha. But if you worship Ganesha only today and then forget him afterwards, it is not right. All the time we should be remembering God. And if we keep on thinking about God all the time, you will not face any difficulties. Because we forget God frequently, we have to face many adversities and difficulties. Any difficulty that we encounter is a reminder to you to think of God; it is not out of any anger of God that He is punishing. Sarvada sarvakaleshu sarvada Harichintanam. Therefore think of God at all times at all places. Then you will not be subjected to any kind of difficulty or misery. Children generally like Ganesha very much. And during exam time, they love Ganesha more. And Ganesha will do overtime work. All students will go to Ganapathi and salute Ganapathi and pray to Him, “Give me good intelligence, memory and good marks in the examinations.” If you put in your effort and think of Ganesha every day, you will not lack anything. There are so many stories like this about Ganapathi. And you study all these stories and enjoy the stories. ",9/17/2015,Special_Occasion,Ganesh Chaturthi
5,Evening Satsang,"Aum Shri Sai Ram. I see Bhagawan seated on this throne in an ochre robe; I repeat as He speaks.
There is Truth in everything; there is everything in Truth; in fact, Truth and everything are one and the same. This is the word of Sai : the path of Truth. 
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Truth is the moral path; Righteousness is the way we live; Love is the eternal flame – when all these three get together, that forms the caste of humanity. 
Man thinking that he is just the body and confining all his activities in life only to the body, is an act of complete ignorance. The body is not permanently the same – when you are born, you are a child; you grow up into a youth and then a man, and finally you get into old age – it keeps changing. That which changes cannot be the Truth – it can only be a momentary fact. Truth is that which is ever changeless at all places at all times. But in this temporary world and the body, all kinds of changes keep taking place. Truth is ever changeless – it does never change. Whatever is Truth, that is the only thing that is eternal and permanent and it is the Truth. The body is ever changing and therefore it cannot be the Truth. When a boy is studying in a school, calling him a student is only a fact – it is not the Truth. When the boy grows up into a teacher or an engineer or a doctor, referring to him as a teacher or an engineer or a doctor is also a fact, it is not the Truth. After some more time, you refer to him as a retired officer, that is also a fact, not the Truth. All things may change but there is one which will never change. That is the Truth. Only the human values practised by the person – truth, integrity, morality – that is what stays permanent. For gold, its effulgence is the testimony; for water, coolness; for fire, heat; similarly what demonstrate humanness in man are the human values. Just looking at the body, you call a person as a human – it is a mistake. Food, sleep, fear and procreation are common for men and animals. One without spiritual moorings – such a man - becomes equivalent to an animal.		
Many people mistake spirituality for study of scriptures, many types of penances or going on pilgrimages. They are only spiritual acts but that is not real spirituality. Adhyatmika means one who has surrendered himself to the atma or God. Whatever may be your activity, when that emerges from the atma that becomes spiritual. Is it possible that we people who are involving ourselves in mundane activities like business or studies or engineering, can we practice spirituality really? Whatever actions we do, naturally we have to reap the consequences of the actions. Is it possible for us to escape from this law of karma and see that we don’t get the consequences? Is it possible for us that we can do whatever we do for the sake of God? All these are possible. 
There are lot of people who call themselves as religious people and say that you will only get the manifestation of God only if you go to this particular temple and follow this ritualistic worship. You may study all religious scriptures, you can go to a forest and perform all kinds of penance and undertake all kinds of ritualistic worship; is it possible for anyone to cross over this law of karma? As long as you have the sense of doership, till then we can’t escape this law. As long as you think whatever you do is being done by your body, naturally the consequences will follow. To think that you are the body and also to feel that all the activities that you undertake through the body are being done by you, is a kind of ignorance. As long as you are doing this, naturally the consequences of all your actions will follow you. All these things happen because of our body consciousness. 
You can analyse your own body in a subtle manner; you can know the Truth. From birth till death, the heart keeps on beating. All of you are beings seated here and inhalation and exhalation take place spontaneously. The food you had at the noon is now digested; now you may be feeling hungry now. Are you doing all these activities? Do you have any kind of control on this metabolism? Can you stop your heart even for a moment? Is it possible for you to revive your heart that has stopped? Then how are they happening by themselves? If you look at it in a subtle way, you know that there is some power which does all this. We see the lights shining and the fans working. Are they working on their own? If you analyse, you will know that it is electric current which makes them work. This inert body is moving and all the activities go on because of the energy of the atma chaitanya. That energy is the Truth. As long as you have that energy, you will be able to involve yourself in all kinds of activity. Body, like a puppet, cannot do anything on its own. If you look into this matter, analyse in a very subtle way, you will be able to recognise the Truth. 
But we forget the truth and when we start thinking that all things are happening because of me, the ego and attachment grow. Ego and attachment arise out of body consciousness. Only when you have body consciousness, ego and attachment will arise. Thinking that this body is the eternal Truth, we keep on nourishing it and also decorating it in many ways; you will never understand that it is only an instrument. But instrument is also required. The body is the basis of all noble activities. For all the four goals of life, physical health is very important. Only through the body we can attain divinity. But at the same time, thinking that body is the eternal Truth and thinking that it is permanent is complete ignorance. You may have any number of tube lights, any number of bulbs, any number of fans; if there is no electric current, they will never work. You may purchase many precious instruments by spending lot of money; if there is no electric current, they will never work. You may be a very powerful person, but if the divine energy does not work through you, you will become a corpse. Therefore we have to recognise the truth that this atmic energy is the ultimate Truth. But as long as we have body consciousness, we cannot recognise this truth. 
Based on this, Adi Shankara also said, “Don’t take pride in your wealth, in your youth and in your power; in one minute everything will be taken away. Realise that it is all a complete illusion and enter into the experience of Brahma or divinity.” When you experience your own divinity, you will also experience that everything in the universe is divinity. And that is the ultimate Truth that one has to know. You will experience the truth that the divinity within you and the divinity that pervades the whole universe are one and the same. Only when you experience this atmic principle, all your sorrows, miseries and difficulties will cease. For the man who has experienced the oneness of this whole existence, where is any attachment for him, where is any sorrow for him? You want to really experience that, you have to get rid of your ego and attachment. 
There are two things which are required if you want to clean up anything – one is water, second is the soap. When soap and water get together, anything can be cleaned up and made pure. Love is the water, service is the soap; using both of them you can get rid of the impurity of ego and attachment. To the extent we love others, to the extent we serve others - to that extent we can experience bliss. Then you will recognise the divinity within ourselves and also experience the truth that everything is divine. 
It is not possible for anybody to change others. First you change yourself. One person had some problem in his eye and therefore, he went to an eye doctor. The doctor told him that you have some problem in your eye; only way you can get rid of that is to always look at the green things. When you look at green colour everywhere, at all times, the eye will get cured. He was a very rich person – the patient - he came back and ordered everybody at home, “Whatever I see should be green in colour. Paint everything that I see in green.” He spent lacs of rupees to paint green all his dresses, costumes, the building, the wall, the flooring, and everything. If anybody wanted to see him, he should come in a green dress. And because he was a big landlord, the whole village was painted green. The doctor was wondering what happened to this person, he never came back; he went to the patient’s home. He was a billionaire, he was a very rich person; and the doctor went to his home. He wanted to enquire how that person was faring. And he saw that there was a complete change in the whole place. Everything was painted green in his home. Doctor was astonished and came and questioned this rich man, “Sir, why you have painted everything? Who did this?” The rich man answered, “You only told me to see only green; therefore, I painted everything green.” “What kind of ignorance is this!” the doctor said. “Instead of spending lacs of rupees and troubling so many people and painting everything green, you should have just spent four rupees and purchased green goggles and you would have seen everything green. When there is green goggle on your eye, the whole word looks green for you.” 
You can’t change the world; you can’t paint the whole world green; first you have to transform yourself. If you fill yourself with love, then the whole world will be filled with love. When you are full of ego and attachment, the whole world will look selfish. Therefore, there is defect in your vision and no defect in the creation. Creation is always all right; because of the defect in your vision, you are seeing everything wrong. When you think that you are divine, you are loving, you are kind, you are compassionate, the whole world will look divine, loving and compassionate. You have to change your vision first. Depending on your vision, creation also changes. It is a mad thing for you to think that the body is permanent and involve yourself in so many activities in order to please the body; it is like that rich man painting the whole place green spending lacs of rupees. 
And you may do anything but your ego and attachment keep on growing. When you offer ghee to fire, fire keeps on growing, it will never diminish. You can never ever satisfy the cravings of the body by enjoying the pleasures of the body. To the extent you enjoy the worldly pleasures, they keep growing. You may lose your money, but you can regain it; you may lose your friend and regain him; you may lose the wife and regain a wife; but once the body is lost, you cannot regain it. This precious human body you have to put it to good use; you should not ruin it being subjected to desire, greed, anger, infatuation and jealousy. You want to satisfy the physical cravings? They keep on growing, they will never cease. The human greed keeps on growing; if you have ten rupees, you desire fifty rupees; if you have fifty rupees, you will desire hundred rupees; if you have hundred rupees, you will desire thousand and keeps on growing that way. 
In a village there was a quarrel between two Brahmins and one Brahmin wanted to punish the other. There was one Brahmin who wanted to follow shortcuts to earn more and more money. And this Brahmin priest was doing all the kinds of worship only out of his greed, not out of devotion to God. But the other Brahmin was a good person. The second person was full of love and with great humility and devotion, he performed all worship. He never had the wicked mind to finish off worship in one place in a great hurry and go to another place in search of money. Generally people are less patient; they don’t have patience. When men sit for worship, the first question they ask is, “How much time does it take? I have to go to office, I have got my business; finish it quickly.” They have time for everything but not for God. Therefore that kind of priest also was thriving very well. And I went to Mumbai and came and saw one such person. In Mumbai there is greater demand for the pujari and the priest than Ganesha himself. You know how much money they have to spend for Ganesha worship? They have to pay the priest ten thousand rupees. Only if you pay ten thousand rupees, the priest will come; otherwise, he will never come. Each priest has two mobile phones. With both phones, they engage themselves with two appointments. And there are also two assistants. Before the chief priest comes, the assistant priest will keep everything ready. And before the chief priest goes there, the assistant priest goes to another place and keeps things ready. When I went to a devotee’s house, I saw that kind of a thief was a priest. The devotee said that to perform this homam, it requires three hours. The priest said, “I have got three plans; you can choose your plan of worship. What you say – that it will take three hours- is correct if you will do everything elaborately. But when you have to do it for three hours, you have to pay more. If I do it in one hour, you have to give me only five thousand rupees. And if you ask me to do it in only half an hour, I will take only two thousand rupees.” So it is not spirituality; this is business. You don’t need any priest for doing worship; you do everything with love and offer it to Krishna by saying ‘Krishnarpanamastu’ or offer to Sai by saying ‘Saishwaraarpanamastu’, that is the fulfilment of all our ritual. There is no worship higher than offering everything that you do to God. Therefore, if you want to get rid of body consciousness, you have to love everybody, serve everybody. Even our own acts of business or duty, that also should be offered to God. You don’t need any scholarship or any ritualistic worship. 
For crossing over the ocean of birth and death, it cannot happen by penance, by visiting pilgrimage centres, by study of scriptures; only by service you can cross over this ocean of samsara. When you give up your ego through service, then you can realise the atma. The light of the atma is ever shining. But because of the lamp’s soot, you are not able to see the light. When you clean up this soot, you can definitely see the light of the atma. That is why I keep addressing you always as the embodiments of the divine atma, embodiments of divine love. I never address you as the embodiments of the human body or embodiments of body consciousness. 
If you want to come to Me, if you want to win My Grace, if you want to enjoy Divine Bliss, you have to give up ego and attachment. A doctor also many times tells you, “Tomorrow morning when you come to me, come with an empty stomach; only then I will give you the medicine.” If you go to the doctor with a belly full, no medicine, no diet will work for you. Similarly when you come to Me, you want to get rid of all the perversions of the mind, come with an empty mind. You come here, mind full of the world; you can never ever learn the lessons of spirituality. If already something is written on the paper, and you write and over write on that, there is nothing you can make out of that. Come with a clean slate and an open mind, then you will be able to learn everything.
One who has sincerity of purpose will attain wisdom. Patience also is very much essential. And people come and find that Sai Baba is not seen and keep on questioning, “I came here and why I am not seeing Sai Baba? Why I am not experiencing anything?” They are in a great hurry. And they want to have Self Realisation in one moment. But that is not the right way. Only when you get rid of worldly cravings little by little, gradually, only then can you realise the Self. You want to get rid of your disease – both medicine and diet are required. For a man with disease, the tongue will find everything bitter, even a sweet. There is nothing wrong with the food, it is wrong with the tongue. You want to set right that – you need both medicine and the diet. And they are love and service. Through the medicine and diet of love and service, you can get rid of this disease of birth and death and attain Godhood. 
Only God is the Truth, the world is an illusion; God is the object, the world is the shadow. If you depend on the shadow, you don’t get anything. If you obtain God, you will get the world automatically. You should ask only for God. If you have God, you have everything. God is Truth. God is Love. God is Peace. Ask for God.",9/20/2015,Spirituality_and_Worldly_Life,
6,Evening Satsang,"Narasimhamurthy has started a new job. It was not good enough for him to write books; now he has become a news reader. And he keeps on telling you things that are happening in many places. All these things are happening only in the outside world. But he did not talk about the kind of transformation that is taking place inside human beings. I have not come in order to go around the world. I want transformation not outside but inside. It is for the inner transformation of human beings that I am going around the world now.  
What is inner transformation? It is not that you have to go away to the forest, give up hearth and home, do penance, do  japa and meditation in order to attain God. Staying where you are staying presently, you give up evil feelings and develop noble feelings – that is when the transformation takes place. Sacrifice is not giving up wife and children and going away to the forest; it is actually giving up our bad feelings and developing good feelings – that is true sacrifice, that is the Truth and that is the word of Sai. Head in the forest, hands in society – that is the ideal. Only when we live according to this ideal, real inner transformation takes place. A lot of people attend satsangs, listen to Swami’s messages but when they go back they don’t practise even a little of what they listen to. Why go so far? From here when people are going back, the husband and wife are fighting in the car only. What for? The discussion is about where to have dinner. They keep fighting over where we should have our dinner- whether we should have at Muddenahalli or at home or on the way in a hotel. After having listened to such high idealism here, and you fight over those little things, that is not the right thing. The satsangas or the discourses will find fulfilment only if you practise at least one little thing that Swami tells you in your lives and experience divine joy.
Joy means Jesus first, others next, yourself last. But on the other hand, if you keep yourself first, others next and Jesus last, joy will be replaced by sorrow. True divinity is to develop selfless feelings. For all the difficulties, for all the misery, for all the conflict in the world, what is the root cause? Root cause is nothing but human selfishness. 
But the country of India is a very spiritual country. If you look at the history of India, people did not struggle for their selfishness. They lived very contented and happy lives and gave great happiness to others also. But today our people are becoming very greedy, comparing ourselves with other people and developing desires and greed. Alexander, when he invaded India and came here, he went around the places including villages in order to see what was happening in India. And he saw that two families were fighting among themselves. One family sold land to the other family. Alexander wanted to know what they were fighting – may be they were fighting over the land, that is what he thought. When one man sold the land to the other man, in the land there was also some treasure. Since the owner of the land did not know about the treasure which was hidden in the land, he only got the money worth for the land. The person who purchased the land came back saying, “I have purchased only the land, not the treasure, you have to accept that back. I have paid only for the land, so I will keep only the land. The treasure belongs to you, take it back.” But the person who sold the land was saying, “I did not know about the treasure when I sold the land; so the treasure belongs to you because today you are the owner of the land.” And because of that there were differences. They were arguing between themselves; the first person saying the treasure belongs to you along with the land; the second person saying only the land belongs to me, treasure belongs to you. But in this Kali Age can we see such kind of bickering? And today you find the owner of a land not only sells his own land, he also sells his neighbour’s land. They will manipulate all kinds of documents to show that they are the owners of the neighbouring land also. Therefore all the time I keep telling Narasimhamurthy whenever you purchase land for the school campuses, you see the documents properly, study them and then only accept. But those days were not like this. People were selfless. Because they were fighting among themselves, they went to elders to get the justice. Elders mean the eldest man in the village. Based on his experience, he told them a solution. You did not know the treasure existed when you sold the lands. Even the person who purchased the land did not know that there was treasure. You are now fighting between you saying that the treasure belongs to the other person. Therefore the judgment that was given was the son of the person who sold the land should marry the daughter of the person who purchased the land. And the treasure should be given as a gift in the marriage. And that is how a solution was found. And everybody accepted that solution. Alexander was ashamed to see this happening. Because of my greed, my country was not sufficient for me. I went over to many countries, invaded them, and caused lot of death and misery and here we see people are so selfless. 
If you study the history of India, you find Indians never invaded any external country. Because of the prosperity of India, people from abroad came and invaded this country but people of India never invaded other countries. And people in India lived a contented life very happily with whatever they had. And Indians were internally very prosperous though they were not very prosperous externally. And their treasure is the spiritual treasure. 
The purpose of going abroad for Me is to teach and share this spiritual treasure and teach them selflessness. All the countries are like compartments in a train. India is like the engine. If there is the engine, engine can take the train to any distance. But because we did not find a good driver, engine has become stand-still. And now again it has started working. And today you find people of India are going abroad and taking the spiritual treasure and teaching them spirituality and spreading joy everywhere. Many sages and saints from India also went over to other countries in order to propagate the spiritual message of the country. Shirdi Baba was born in the state of Maharashtra; Prema Sai would be born in Karnataka state and he will go all over the world and propagate the spiritual message of the country. Shirdi Baba was confined to Maharshatra and he lived there and propagated the message only there. Sathya Sai Baba went all over India, established many centres and institutions and preached spirituality. But when Prema Sai makes his advent, he will go over to all countries and spread the message of spirituality. The first Avatar was only for the state; the second Avatar for the whole of nation; the third Avatar will go around the whole world. And what I am doing now is – I am just preparing the foundation for this movement of Prema Sai. For any big building, very strong foundation is required. I am now creating the foundation required. And all this will become a huge mansion in future. And I am seeing to it that in seventeen countries, the ashrams will come up; I will enthuse the people and inspire them to see to it that they take to this path. Already people of ten countries are starting ashrams in their countries. And in a very short time I will go to the other seven countries and also start these ashrams there.
Why am I starting all these ashrams? Why am I starting so many schools? For all people to come here is very difficult. Therefore I am going to where people are. And my purpose is to go over to those countries, enthuse them and take to the spiritual path being in their own countries. They should follow their own caste, creed and religion. I have not come to establish any religion or caste or creed. In every religion there are two principles – love and sacrifice. They have to just understand the two principles of every religion and practise them. Whether it is Hinduism or Buddhism or Jainism or Christianity or Sikhism, everywhere the principle that is taught is love. People can give up their narrow-mindedness if they develop the principle of love. In all our ashrams we have to see to it that people of every religion, every country, every caste and creed will get entrance. We have to see to it that we synthesise the teachings of all religions, see to it that all people come there. This is what I am telling devotees in every country. We should not preach narrow-mindedly only one religion, we should preach the essence of all religions. Any ashram that we start should be open to everybody. And people of every religion can come there and pray there. And it should be synthesis of all religions. And all the devotees were very delighted and very happy. And many of them were selling their properties and spending the money on Swami’s work .It is not properties but it should be proper ties.
 Happiness is union with God. Our true relationship should be with God and not with the world. Proper ties are the proper relations. The kind of relation between the devotee and God is the right kind of relation; all others are bondages. Therefore you develop relationship with God – that is the atmic relationship. 
And the coming times are very great and glorious. Many of you are thinking you are sitting in a small hall and listening to Swami; you may think that things will continue only this way. Not at all. There are going to be great changes. The whole world will come to this place. The things will keep on growing. Where there is God, all things will follow. If you want God, you should become good. Therefore you have to give up your narrow-mindedness, selfishness and self-interest and develop broad-mindedness and selflessness. Whatever you think, whatever you say and whatever you do, all things should be done for the love of God. You ask yourself the question whether God would like what you are doing; only if He likes it, you should do it, otherwise no. No point in repenting after doing. That is only repentance. You have to think of it even before you do things. You think before you do things – that will be the right thing.  Therefore make your words good, make your actions also good.
A lot of devotees are feeling bad that Swami is going on long trips outside and nobody is there to care for us here. To think that Swami is somewhere outside is a big mistake. All of you have a radio. When you tune the radio properly, you can listen to the songs also. What is that radio? Mind is the radio. Tuning is making the thought, word and deed one and the same. When you involve yourself in good thoughts, good words and good actions, then that is proper tuning. When you have that kind of unity, then you get purity. Purity is what leads to proper tuning. When you attain perfect purity, you will also attain divinity. When you develop that kind of goodness in you, you will be able to see God everywhere at all times. It is not right for us keeping our own radio, we look for other people’s radios. Therefore you tune your own radio and listen to the divine songs. How long do we depend on other’s radios? I have created everybody equally. I have always been telling that everybody is the embodiment of the divine. You have to draw out the divinity within you outside and experience it. Therefore you have to put in the needed effort. Nobody can eat for you, nobody can breathe for you, nobody can sleep for you; similarly you have to attain your own divinity. All of you have the divinity within you. But you have to put in the effort. Through effort you can achieve anything. 	
Now it is raining. And all of you are feeling bad. And within a short time, the big hall will be ready. In that hall, ten thousand people can sit there. We are going to inaugurate the hall on 18th November. So all of you should attend the inaugural function on the 18th November. If you go and see there, you will have a doubt whether it will be ready for 18th November – not 18th November, it may not be ready for 18th June 2016 also! All people are toiling day and night in order to get it ready for the inauguration.
On 19th morning, we are going to inaugurate the World Youth Meet. A lot of young men and women will come here from other countries. And they are also going to set up western canteens for the western people. We are going to have the western canteen and also the Indian canteen. There are going to be programmes for five days. On Birthday, the programmes will culminate. A lot of important dignitaries will also participate in these functions. When such good work is happening, you should not sit idle keeping your hands together. Through hands, you have to do service. To the extent possible, you do the service. It is not right for you to think I will come on 18th and sit and enjoy the function. Only those who are coming from other countries are guests, all of us are hosts. Because the whole world is coming here we have to look after their welfare.
 From the 90th birthday onwards all the programmes will happen in that hall. When I was planning and building this hall, Narasimhamurthy was doubting. He does not want to spell out his mistakes. He was thinking why we should build such a big hall. Your mind is small, your intelligence is small and that is why you are thinking in a very small way. But I think in a broad way. And if people come for you sake then this hall is not required. Because for Me the whole world is going to come; therefore,  I need a big hall. People are not coming for you; they are coming for Me. From all nations people will come for My sake. Even this hall will not be enough. When Prema Sai makes his advent, a lot of programmes will happen in this hall. This big hall is required. A lot of devotees are putting in very hard work in order to complete it within time. You want to build such a big hall you require at least three years. It is only Divine Will which is able to complete this hall within nine months. All of you should involve yourselves in some service activities. ",10/4/2015,Mission,
7,Evening Satsang,"Lord is the embodiment of all the names of God; He is the personification of peace. All the forms that we ascribe to God are His and He is the embodiment of goodness. All names and forms are His; His nature is eternal Truth, Awareness and Bliss and He is the embodiment of Truth, Beauty and Goodness.
Embodiments of the divine Atma,
Since many ages, man has been trying to describe the nature of God. Some people say that God has a form and some others say that God is formless. Some people say that He is attributeless, while many others believe that He has many great and noble and good qualities. Many people try to understand God but none of them could really fathom Him. It is said in the Upanishads that the mind cannot comprehend Him, nor the tongue describe Him. Can you take water in a sieve? If you put water into a sieve, the water will leak away. Therefore it is impossible that we can understand God through our minds. But God who is the resident of our heart – we can find Him only in our heart. 
God is always full of these three qualities – truth, beauty and goodness. What is Sathya? Sathya is truth which is changeless – that which will never change. From birth to death, lot of changes take place in our bodies.  Our forms keep changing from a child to the youth, then a man and then an old man. That which changes cannot be the Truth. Truth is that which never changes. That is the nature of the atma. God who is the resident and indweller in everybody is one not subjected to any change. Therefore in a way, we can say God is that which will never change. The second is Shivam. That is auspiciousness. Shivam is that which grants auspiciousness to everyone -that is merit. Helping others is merit; hurting others	is sin. That principle which confers auspiciousness, joy and bliss on every one – that is Shivam. The third is Sundaram. When we see something which is very beautiful, immediately bliss arises in our hearts. Therefore that which is blissful – that is beautiful. Therefore, if you want to describe God, you can describe Him as Truth, Beauty and Goodness. The ever changeless Truth is God. That which confers good, welfare and bliss on everyone - that is God. In every age, God comes down as an avatar in the human form and teaches the truth about Himself and goodness of life but if you want to understand the real formless God, then you can only describe Him as Truth, Beauty and Goodness.
Schools may be different, media of instruction many be different but the lessons taught in every school are the same. One may be an English-medium school, another may be a Hindi-medium, Telugu medium or Kannada medium school, but the lesson taught is one and the same. Teachers also may be different. If you go to a Christian school – somebody may have the attire of a priest or a Father; if you go to another school somebody can dress up like a Hindu priest but the lessons taught by them are one and the same. All religions, all philosophies may be different but the lessons taught are one and the same. That is Truth, Beauty and Goodness. 
God is Eternal. And He is never born, never dies but He pervades everybody in the form of Bliss.  He will always help others, He will never hurt others. He always confers Bliss on everyone and never sorrow on everyone. Wherever you find these three attributes or qualities, there you will find God. Therefore any human being who adheres to truth, who confers joy on everybody, helps everybody – he himself is God.
Depending on various religions and teachings, with a narrow-mindedness to think that God is different in different religions is absolutely a mistake. Forms may be different but the essence is one and the same. Even in our hostels , we provide all kinds of sweets to our students. Those who like mysorepak will eat mysorepak, some people eat jamoon; there may be different sweets but sugar which gives sweetness is one and the same. You want to understand that God, you need to understand the principle underlying it.	Name and form may be different but the principle is one and the same. That is Truth, Goodness and Beauty. Those people who practise and love these qualities, they will get all wisdom. We should always adhere to truth. 
What is Truth?
 Body is a water-bubble; today it is there, tomorrow it is not there. As long as the water bubble exists, you can see all kinds of pictures on the reflections of the water bubble but it is untruth; once the water bubble bursts, all the pictures will disappear. Similarly, the body made up of five elements is also temporary and you have to lose it one day or the other. What is temporary is not God. God is eternal. Therefore the nature of the atma is permanent and eternal. Body is a water bubble, do not follow the body. 
Mind is a mad monkey. The mind tells you something today and something else tomorrow. Because mind also keeps changing, it cannot be the Truth.
 But heart always tells you the same thing. Therefore when you follow the heart, you can experience God. Where is the heart? Heart is not the machine that works in your body. That is only the physical heart which is very temporary. The true heart is the spiritual heart. That which is filled with compassion is the heart. Where there is compassion, there is the spiritual heart. Only in that compassion can you see God. In a barren land, you cannot see the reflection of God. But you can see the reflection in clear water- in a well. Therefore if well does not have the water, you can’t see the reflection. In pure, clear water in the well, you can also see your reflection. Therefore only in that heart where there is the sacred water of love, there we can see God. In a body which is full of selfless love, you can see God – not in a desert. Therefore if you fill your hearts with selfless love, you can see God in your own heart. 
God is everywhere, omnipresent, at all times. But you can’t see Him; you can’t listen to Him. Why? Because you have filled your eyes with worldliness. And your ears are also filled with worldliness. When you can give up worldliness and contemplate on God, you can definitely know God. Where there is ‘I’, there is no Sai. Where there is Sai, there is no ‘I’.’I’ is ego, selfishness and attachment. Where there is selfishness, there is no God. It is a desert like heart and there cannot be the sacred water. If you see why this world is full of so much injustice and 	unrighteousness, the simple reason is selfishness and self-interest. Everybody is living in the confinement of I and mine. Because of ego and attachment, you are not able to realise God. When we give up selfishness, develop selflessness, then you can see God. However much you may try, you will not be able to find Him outside. You can’t search Him outside yourself – you have to search where He is: that is inside. And God has installed Himself as the resident of your heart.  That is here you have to search for Him and you will find Him.
One rich man went o a pilgrimage. Those days there were no hotels. And he had to spend his time in a choultry those days. Along with the rich man, there was a servant who followed him. The servant always had his eye cast on his wealth and not to serve him. Today everywhere you can find many banks and you can put your money and withdraw it. Those days no banks were existing. Whatever money was required, you have to take with you on the pilgrimage. He put all his money in a box and locked it up and he was taking it. One evening they were in a choultry. Servant all the time had his mind only on the box and not on serving his master. All the time he was thinking I should get the key, open the box and take away all the money. Then it was night. Both of them slept. The rich man slept but the servant did not sleep. He pretended to sleep but did not sleep. And when the rich man was snoring, the servant got up. He was looking for the key everywhere. First he looked under the bed of the rich man –he could not find it; and he searched in his clothes- he could not find it; even under the pillow he saw, he could not get it. And finally he was tired after a lot of effort and therefore he slept off. The rich man got up in the morning and asked the servant, “Now I have to go for my bath. Get me clothes from the box and give me.” Servant asked him, “I don’t have the key. How will I open the box?” “Whole night you were searching for it; why did not you get it?” “Excuse me, I searched for it but I could not get it.” “I hid it under your pillow – that is where you did not see.”
Similarly, man is going around searching for God in places where He is not there, he doesn’t look for Him where He is. God is not in the external space; He is inside us. One of the boys sang ‘Anataranga Sai’ – He is the indweller in eveyone. The formless God has come down with a human form and moved around with you; it is a mistake for you to think that that is the ultimate Truth. 
What is the meaning of God Incarnating? 
With love and compassion for humanity, God comes down to their level in their world. Along with individual consciousness, he also enjoys Divine Consciousness. Formless God comes down in every age as the divine incarnation, Avatara. The God who is inscribed in the principles of Truth, Goodness and Beauty– He cannot be found outside. They body comes and goes. But God is not the body. Therefore, it is a big lie to say that Sai Baba came and Sai Baba went. You can tell the truth that Sai Baba came with a body and the body left. But He is demonstrating the real nature of the atma. He is always eternal.
 If you want to listen to the songs from a radio, you have to tune the radio. Various radio stations broadcast different songs. If you want to listen to the songs, you have to put on the radio, and tune it to the right station; then only you can listen to the songs. Mind is the radio. Thoughts are the tuning. When you keep all your thoughts on the world, only those things relating to the world, you will be able to listen. When you tune your thoughts to be divine thoughts, then everything looks divine. If you want to enjoy both American and Indian stations simultaneously, there is only going to be confusion- you can’t listen to anything proper. There will be only noise and no voice. Similarly, if you want both God and the world, you will get into confusion – you can’t get both. If you get God, you can’t get the world. When you get the world, you won’t get God. You should understand the inner meaning of this. 
God is real, world is shadow. Only God is real, the world is a mirage. For every object, there is a shadow. The world is nothing but reflection, reaction and resound. Real object is God Himself. If you get the object, will you not get the shadow also along with it?
One day a person wanted a coconut and he was climbing the tree. But the tree is very long. And somebody else who was observing this person told him, “Why are you struggling? There is a shadow coconut tree. You can easily get the coconut there.” May be in the shadow coconut you can get it   easily, but it will not quench your thirst. Only when you get on to the real coconut tree, you will get the shadow also. You will get the real tree and the shadow also together.
 It’s enough if we get God. In God, there is the world. ‘G’ means generation – creation. ‘O’ means organising i.e. the one who sustains. Third is ‘D’, one who destroys. Therefore in the word GOD  there is creation, sustenance and destructiuon. If you get that God, you will also get the creation. All the time I will be telling the students, “If somebody asks you what you want, you should just say- I want God. That is enough.”
A rich man had three wives. All the time the three wives would demand things. One wife loved saris; the second wife loves only the jewels. And whenever she asks for a sari, he would open the almirah to give her money. And similarly when the second wife demanded the jewels, he would give her money. He asked the third wife, “You are not asking for anything anytime?””Will you give me what I want?” “I will surely give you; am I not giving them what they asked?” “Give me the locker key. That is enough. Then I will look after other things.” Similarly if you get God, it is enough. If you get God, you will get everything because everything is in God. Therefore if you keep asking all the time -I want God. I want God – that is enough.
 You are God; but you don’t know that you are God and that is why you are suffering. You are also God; I am also God; everyone is God. I know I am God, you do not know you are God. Know that you are God; become God. One who knows God, becomes God. Therefore, God is Truth, Beauty and Goodness. When you follow the truth and give joy and happiness by helping others, you will also become God. Love All, Serve All and through that you attain divinity and enjoy bliss.	 		.

8,SSSCHE Discourse,"When you have the kalpavriksha itself near you, where there is a need for looking and developing attachment to other trees? When you have the Kamadhenu – wish fulfilling cow – with you, which  gives you the milk that you desire, why do we need to go and purchase cows outside with money? When the glorious Meru mountain made of gold is there with you, why do we need to go looking for silver and gold elsewhere? When Lord Himself is by your side who grants devotion and liberation, why do we need to desire for the world? That’s not worth it. 
My very dear students,
Today I got up very early and I was ready to come here. I have been waiting since 8 o’ clock to come here. But because of the people around Me, I became late. That is not My fault. I knew that today all of you are waiting for Swami to come, speak to you; therefore, I could not sleep much and I was all the time thinking that I am going to see My children in the morning. I could not wait for the sun to rise. I rose before the sun to get ready and come here quickly. But as you all know there are many other works that Swami has got to do. There are many other people that Swami has to meet, guide. Therefore, there was a delay.
 But the more you wait for the food, the tastier it feels. 	The more the hunger, tastier is the food. Therefore, now I am here to serve you this food of bliss and satisfy your hunger for Me.
Many many days have passed since I wanted to come here and be with you and talk to you. But due to several other commitments like travelling to many other countries, it was impossible. However, you hall have always been in My mind, My heart wherever I went, I only spoken about you – the boys and teachers of Centre for Excellence. 
Though Krishna seemingly had thousand wives, Satyabhama and Rukmini being the closest, still even today, we remember Radha along with Krishna. We have temples of Radha-Krishna; even in Radha and Krishna, Radha is first and Krishna afterwards. What made Radha become so close to Krishna though physically they were far away? Her selfless devotion to Krishna – she did not want anything other than Krishna. She said, “I shall not drink from the puddles of water even if I am thirsty, for they are contaminated by the earth. I shall wait like the chaataka bird to quench my thirst directly from the raindrops. No worldly pleasures can satisfy me other than one look of you, my dear Krishna. And it is only for you that I wait like the chaataka bird without wavering from this path of devotion.” Physically though they were apart, yet in their hearts, they were the closest. 
So even though physically I had been away, but in My heart of hearts, of all My children, I always remember you, talk about you, think about you. And always think what else can I do to make you all happy, to make you all comfortable? And I always question whenever I see your Director or your Warden, whether my children are happy, whether they are getting everything that they need, whether they are living together as brothers, whether they are loving and serving each other. This is the only questions that I always ask.
Somebody told that Swami left His family at the age of 14. And then declared to the world that He is here for the sake of His devotees. Truthfully, what is this family of Mine? Not the people to whom this body was born. That is not the family. That is all rakta sambandham – that is blood relations. But ours is atma sambandham- relation of the soul. And this family bond is far stronger than all other bonds made of blood. As the body dies and blood is discharged, the relationships also disappear. But spirit which remains eternal and never dies – the relationships based on that spiritual bond will also remain eternal. Ours is a relation of the atma, or the spirit and not that of the blood. That is temporary; this is permanent. Therefore, never think that Swami is too far from you. Every time you think of Me, I am thinking of you. Even your ability to think of Me is also My Grace. For I am thinking of you. Otherwise how do you explain that out of crores of people on earth, only a few know about Me? And amongst the few of those who know about Me, very few only think of Me. It is only by My Grace. The way you can see the sun only through the light of the sun; likewise you can think of God only through His Grace. 
Nothing else in this world can match up to the joy that one gets in the proximity of the Lord. Everything else feels stale and tasteless once you have tasted this nectar of love which only God is capable of giving. All other waters that you may drink from to quench your thirst are contaminated by the touch of the earth. However, God’s Love is like the pure rain, unsullied and reaches you to you like amrutham to quench your thirst permanently. Therefore, crave only for God. If you have God with you, the whole world is also with you. 
The world is nothing but reflection, reaction and resound. God is the object, world is merely a reflection. Running behind the reflection will not give you anything. It is temporary, it is an illusion. See, when you wake up, your shadow is taller than you. As the day progresses, your shadow becomes short so much so that it is right under you. As the time progresses further, again it becomes long. This shadow is not permanent but the body of which the shadow is, is real. Likewise, God alone is real. Based on time, space and situations, the world and the people of the world keep changing. In good times, everybody is your friend. Like the frogs in the well when the water is full. Now it is raining well and you see there are too many frogs and snakes around. Where were they all these years when there was no water in Muddenahalli? They all came because water came. All worldly friendships are like that. If you have something to give, only then they are there around you. And we have nothing to give them of their likes, they all disappear. Only God remains with you throughout permanently. Therefore if you have anything to ask, you only ask for God. I want God, nothing else. For if you get God, you get everything.
 I often tell this story that a prince on his birthday wanted to give away gifts of all kinds to the people. He displayed all the wealth in the palace for people to come and take as they wished. The only condition was you can only only so much as it comes in your two palms. Everybody went mad running here and there to pick up the most precious of the gems that were put there on display. The prince was smiling to himself looking at the madness that the people had. However, in one corner was a little young girl standing without touching anything. Looking at her clothes, she seemed to be quite poor. The prince was surprised. He went up to her and asked, “Don’t you want to take something that interests you as much as your two hands can carry, as much as it fits into your two plams?” She smiled to the prince and said, “They all are foolish people who are very satisfied with that which comes only in their two palms. But you cannot fool me with your maya of all that glitters around you. In my two hands, I want to hold your two hands. You become mine. If I have you, I have the whole kingdom. I don’t have to short change myself with limited things when I have the unlimited in my hands.” Therefore she held the hands of the prince in her two hands and said, “This is all I want to take back with me in my two hands.” The prince was mighty pleased and he gave himself away. 
Those who want wealth, I bless them with wealth. Those who want families, I bless them with families. Those who want position and name, I bless them with that. But those who ask for Me, I bless them with that too. If you have Me, you have everything. There is nothing that you cannot have once you have God. For God alone is reflecting in the whole world and the whole world reflects within God and God and world cannot be separated. This is the Truth. If you have God, if you have the object, you have the shadow too. 
Listening to your talks, listening to your songs, My heart is full. A farmer derives great joy when he sees that all the hard work he has done – to till the land, to plough the soil, to sow the seeds, provide water, protect it from pests – and then when the season is right, the crop comes up; looking at that, farmer derives great joy. When I come here and see that those seeds that were sown just two years ago are now slowly growing into a healthy crop,  that gives me great joy like that of the farmer. 
This body has been given only for the sake of serving others. Therefore, all our life we must learn to serve. Yes, you are going to be the leaders or the nayakas. But before you become the nayakas or leaders, you must learn to become the sevaka or the servant. Servant is a true leader. One who follows alone can lead. Become servant.
Soon the whole world is going to come to this small ashram. Yesterday Narasimhamurthy was asking Me how is going to be when Prema Sai is going to be here. How would it be? How many people would come? What would be going on? How would he behave? How would he talk? Would he give discourses? Would he give interviews? See, Narasimhamurthy is very curious you see. He is always that way. I told him all that is of no use if you are not spiritually prepared to understand his silence. If you can’t understand My words today, how can you understand the silence of Prema Sai? Therefore develop this inner relationship – the relationship where much is spoken in the language of silence and words are poor conduits of one’s thoughts. That inner relationship if you develop with me then only you can understand what will happen tomorrow. Else, like a primary school child, if he is made to sit in a university class, what would he understand? Nothing. Likewise people may come, sit, listen, see but they may not understand anything. They will think, “Oh, this avatar knows not much. Therefore it chooses not to speak. There is nothing much to gain here,” and they will leave. 
Only those who truly have served could get rid of their minds which is an obstacle. It creates noise all the time and you cannot hear the voice of the heart. Only when mind is banished, will the heart be heard. Therefore develop this heart-to-heart relationship. That is our true relationship. Everybody has this. All are divine. All have this connection within. But one has to put efforts to develop this and strengthen it. When you were born, you were not capable of walking or talking or writing or speaking but you learnt it by practice and practice alone you have mastered it. Today you are able to stand up and speak in the mikes or sing or play the harmonium or table – all these you have acquired by practice. Likewise, this connection within also has to be developed and strengthened through practice. Organisations will grow. More people will come. Nothing can stop that.	Where there is a flower full of nectar, no need to invite the bees? They will come on their own. You can’t stop them. Likewise people will come here and you will see the very first instance of that during the coming Birthday celebrations. 
I have come here to tell you that when they all come they are all going to look up to you. You are the closest to Swami, you are the dearest to Swami here. They will all look to you at you to see what makes you all so dear to Bhagawan. What is that which qualifies you to be close to Swami all the time? What is that within you which makes Swami think of you all the time? And therefore they are all going to look at you. You are not one but three – the one you think you are, the one others think you are and the one you really are. Therefore, what others think of you is also very important – the way you behave, the way you serve, the way you help, the way you sacrifice- all this will be seen and felt by people who are not known to you but looking at you they will know that yes, Swami is definitely here because we see Swami’s reflection in all these people. How can shadow form without the object? How can reflection form without the object? How can so much of love be in the hearts of all these people if the source of all love – Sai Baba- is not here? It is the same sun that shines in all the water-bodies: they are not different suns. Likewise, it is My love that will reflect in all of you. And when people come, interact with you and see you, they would feel Me. This is your responsibility. There are no rights without responsibilities. If you fulfil your responsibilities, you need not beg for rights – you all get your rights by itself.  Fulfil the responsibility of living up to the name of Swami, of living up to the expectation of devotees from Swami’s students by serving them, loving them and taking care of them like their own. No one should feel that they have come to a new place or a strange place. They should all feel that they have come to their own place by being with you all. 
Many boys in the Centre of Excellence have been very good sevakas i.e servants. They don’t see the time, place, situation – whenever there is a need to serve, they are always ready. I don’t want to mention names but I know that many of you are like that. They don’t care about their own comforts, their own convenience. But they are ready to go wherever Swami asks them to, wherever their teachers tell them to. Be like that all the time. Always be ready to serve.
 It is not just the dream of one person or two persons. It is the prayers of many many rishis, munis and great yogis that such noble people shall be prepared to redeem the world of all that which is wrong. The coming yajnam is the beginning of the new age when both Prakriti and Parameshwara - Shiva and Shakthi –are being called upon to come together as a single force and redeem the world of all the evil. You are all very fortunate to be here in this great time. The night is vanishing and the day is about to dawn and this is the Brahmamuhurtha- the most auspicious of all times. 
Being in this time and doing what is needed will help you and help others too reach your own divinity. All of you should prepare teams through which you can serve during the coming yajnam as well as during the Birthday celebrations. But at the same time you have to do well in your academics as well. Therefore do not waste a single minute. Whenever you find time, with complete concentration, study well, grasp whatever is needed while you are in the class. Have such concentration that you do not have to reopen the book to revise. At the very first instant it should go and stay in your minds. Develop such good concentration – concentration is the first step towards spirituality. Mind without concentration cannot achieve anything in this world. Then what to talk about God? Develop good concentration by continuously focusing – where your body is, that’s where should your mind also be. Where your mind is, that’s where your heart should also be. Body, mind and heart being in the same place is concentration. Therefore, give hundred per cent of your time when you are doing a particular thing. That is what is living in the present. When you are in the class, think of what is being taught. Clear your doubts then and there. Digest whatever is being served. You can’t keep it in your stomach till tomorrow. You have to digest it then and today.
Likewise teachers and students must use of every single minute to make best use of it to finish your academic syllabus in order to be free during the festivals to help others are serve others who are coming. I want you people to take leadership roles and go and take care of every item that is part of the festival. World Youth Meet is there – many many people from around the world will come. They will look at you for guidance. I expect the teachers, elders to sit down and think carefully and handle in a very detailed way how they want to help in all these functions that are coming without affecting the academics or studies of the students.
Ability – nobility both are very important. While devotees will look at you based on your character and service, the world outside will look at you based on the marks that you obtain. Therefore both are equally important. It’s not enough if tumbler is clean from inside; it should be clean and shiny from outside too. So both ways you must do well.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is everything all right here? Do you have everything  that you need? Is Kamath too strict? You should thank your fortune for I did not make Narasimhamurthy your Warden.
It seems one day a person was very very sad. He came and told, “Swami, there are many problems in my home. I am not at peace at all.” Then the Swamiji told, “Do you have cows?” “Yes, Swamiji, they are outside in the goshaala.” “Do one thing – go back and tie all the cows inside the house. Your problem will be solved.” He did not understand but he went and got all the cows and got them tied inside the house. The problem aggravated. He came and told, “Swami, my life is more miserable than before. Now children, wife and cows all stay together and it’s terrible.” Swamiji said, “Ok, take the cows out and tie them back in the goshala.” He did that and came back and said, “Now my house is so peaceful.” If you think Kamathanna is difficult, you don’t know what Narasimhamurthy can be. If I send him here for ten days then you will be very happy to be with Kamathanna.
Manjunath Sir is very very soft-hearted. He doesn’t scold anybody. Whatever children say, to everything he says, Yes- yes-yes. You should say yes to good things but sometimes you have to talk in a strong way. Swami was never angry with anybody but to correct He will only change the tone of His voice. In order to express something you don’t have to use harsh words or use difficult sentences. You don’t have to be unkind. But by changing the tone of your voice, you can let the children know where they have to get corrected. But love should be the undercurrent. So love is the source, everything will change permanently. Through strictness, force, it will only be a temporary change.
We went to Singapore; everybody was driving so correctly. I was so happy to see the discipline that they maintain in Singapore. I asked Dr. Ravi Pillai, “How come all these people are maintaining so much of discipline? Is it because they are all very disciplined people?” He said, “No Swami, there are very big penalties for breaking rules. “ Then it is all force. The moment you remove the penalties, they will again become very bad.  All the things which is from force will not last long. Only permanent changes will happen if it comes from the Source. Source is Love. Keeping Love as the basis whatever you do will remain permanent.
Narayan Bhat did not build his institutions by giving up all his wealth for the sake of proving anything to anyone. He did it purely out of the love that he had for everyone. That is why it has remained permanent. And i will remain permanent. It will only grow from here. Grow, expand and reach all parts of the country.  We have children n from many many places. 
Dr. Raman Singh, the Chief Minister of Chattisgarh, is coming here. He didn’t know about Swami; he did not see Swami. But when he saw the hospital and the good work happening in Raipur, he said, “Even government is not able to do this. We started a hospital; it went on for seven years; still we could not start a surgery. Here within one year they started and now they are doing so many surgeries .Definitely it is Baba’s Grace.” He wants to come here and see all of you. Such type of new people- new devotees are going to come who have seen the good work and through good work they have got to know about God. That is the right way. 
All of you should be ready; finish all your syllabus, finish all your studies quickly and be free. Doing seva, thinking of studies- both - is not good. When you are doing one thing, hundred per cent you should only do that thing.  Then it will be correct. 
So all teachers, elders, students should spend the time correctly. Don’t waste any time. With concentration, you can do things very fast. If you have good concentration, one hour’s work can be done in ten minutes. If you have bad concentration, ten minutes work also will take one hour. Good concentration is key to success. Swami had such good concentration that in class if He sits, even once if He hears what teachers are telling, it will get imprinted; He will never forget. He never had  to open a book and revise. He had such concentration that He would write His answer paper in no time and then He will write other people’s papers also. That was then; now I don’t do all this. You have to eat for yourself, you have to sleep for yourself, you have to study for yourself. That was for My friends who were very devoted to Me. Sometimes there are such exceptions but not always. 
This year we did not go out to Bandipur; after all our functions are over when we have litte time, that time we will go.
Are all teachers teaching well? Are you understanding whatever is being taught? Then it should reflect in your marks cards also. Should get better marks than before. First year it is the beginning; many people came from Kannada medium to English medium; people came from outside; it took time to adjust. But this year, it should be very good marks. First year I did not say much. This year if you don’t get good marks, then I’ll definitely come and talk to you more on that. We can’t clap with one hand. Teacher’s effort, student’s effort – both should be together. Then only you can achieve success. Teachers go on putting effort; if you don’t put in equal effort, it will not be of much use. 
Next year more students are going to join. Will you be able to adjust and live in this small place? I went to Gulbarga. I told the students, “The hostel is getting ready. Are you able to adjust and live in this small place?” They said, “Yes, Swami.” “Are bathrooms enough?” “No, Swami.” “Then how are you adjusting?” ”One day I have bath, one day he has bath.” That is no adjustment. 
Very happy.
How many people have passports? Nobody has. You should make passports. When Narasimhamurthy joined, he did not have anything – no licence, no passport, no bank account, nothing. Like you all. Everything I only have to go and get it for him. He just trusted Me with everything. He told, “I am here for Swami. Whatever Swami wants me to do, I will do.” I told, “That is enough. You don’t need to do anything. Just do what Swami says. And I will take care of everything. Now he is travelling to all different parts of the world. Earlier only between Brindavan –Puttaparthi-Muddenahalli. That is all his world was. Now 17 countries he has gone to. This year we are going to go to many more countries. All the places I am establishing the ashram for Prema Sai. And once it is all ready, he will also travel. And he will travel as a young boy with many young boys as his group-mates. Sixteen boys will be travelling with him all the time. These sixteen will be his main disciples who will be him all the time wherever he goes. First 25 years, less travel. Next 25 years more travel around the world. Small life. Fifty-five years. Somebody said you don’t need a big life; the earlier we learn, the better it is. Quantity is not important; quality is important. They will all come here; the ashram will be here; then he will travel all around the place. 
When you all grow old and you would have lost all the hair like the elders here, you can write books about all this what is happening now. You will not understand what is happening now today. But few years from now, when you look back and see then you will know that what Swami was saying was all right. 
Very happy.
What time is your lunch? Is it time for lunch? Is the food good? Are they giving all the items as per the list? All the items on the list or some they are removing based on their likes? Do you have the list with you? Then how will you know whether they are giving everything? Gopi has list.
 How many will come to Alike after now? In November? If you have studied well and if your teachers say they can go to Alike, I will take you all to Alike – end of November. We don’t need a passport for Alike. But you’ll need it later. For Singapore.
(To Vijay Sai) Their English has definitely improved but it has to be improved further. Too fast they talk, then they will make mistakes. If you talk slowly, you can think and talk, then you will not make mistakes. So teach them to think slowly.  Eating also you should do slowly, speaking also should do slowly. But English is better than before.
Are you all confident talking in English now? I am still not confident. You have to practise a little more. Everything we should know. Kannada also we should know, English also we should know, Telugu also we should know. The more languages you know, the better it is for you. But know everything correctly.
Very happy.",10/8/2015,Mission,
9,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam Volunteers Discourse 1,"God and Nature are always together. And the relationship between God and Nature is inseparable and relationship of oneness. And this is the word of Sai, the path of Truth.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
The relationship that exists between the Creator and the Creation is something which can never be separated; which can never be distinguished against. Wherever there is an object, there is a reflection also. Wherever there is an action, there is a reaction also. Whenever there is a sound, there is an echo also. God is the object and the Creation or Nature is the reflection of God. Therefore, there are only two things that exist. The first is the Truth that is the object that is God and His reflection that is Creation or Prakriti. The world exists because of the combination of God and Nature. 
Originally God is formless. In order to start the work of Creation, God separated His power, His strength into form of a Goddess, Parameshwari. This Goddess is the spouse or the consort of God. The whole Creation happened because of the combination of God and this Goddess. In the same way as 	a child	is born	from the womb of the mother, in the same way, God and Goddess get together to give birth to this Creation in the form of Hiranyagarbha. The relationship between God and Goddess is not physical but spiritual and subtle. God and Goddess got together and created Hiranyagarbha and from there emerged this Universe. We do worship this Hiranyagarbha as the golden Linga. 
There is also meaning for the shape of the Linga. There is no beginning, no end for this Linga. There is nothing called the middle part. This Hiranyagarbha Linga is nothing but one which has no origin, no beginning, no end and no middle. The Hiranyagarbha Linga looks alike from any direction, from any angle you look at it. Therefore we can call it the perfect shape.
From that perfect Lingam, Hiranyagarbha, has originated all this Universe. The scientists also have been conducting many investigations in order to find out the origin of the Universe, but the truth is that it emerged from the Hiranyagarbha. It is only a kind of energy. It is not physical; it is energy – unseen energy without a shape and form. That energy gets into this Hiranyagarbha Linga. Depending on that, we do worship God and Creation as Purusha and Prakriti. This Shiva-Shakthi gave birth to this Hiranyagarbha and hence, the Universe. The Universe also has the shape of the Linga. That is why human beings keep worshipping this Linga. To think only Shiva is there in the Lingam is a mistake. In Lingam there are both Shiva and Shakthi.
And this Ati Rudra Yajna is that kind of yajna. In the same way as there are various departments in the government – water department, electricity department, roads department, municipality department- similarly, in order to run this vast Universe, God has also created many departments. Among this there are three functions which are important – one is creation, second is sustenance and third is destruction. God and Goddess, Parameshwara and Parameshwari, get together to give birth to this Universe and there are three important functions of creation, sustenance and annihilation. We do name these three functional heads as Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara.
In the same way as the primordial God created His power –formless- into a formless aspect of the Goddess, similarly Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara also have separated their powers in the feminine forms. Therefore in order to manifest this physical universe from the subtle fundamental basis, the same thing happened.
Suppose you want to build a building, first you should call an architect and you have to plan the building. The architect first knows the requirements of the building and then in his mind he thinks of how it should be. Therefore the first creation happened in the mind of the architect. That is the subtle form. Similarly if you want to transform this subtle Hiranyagarbha into the physical universe, we also need people like engineers, architects and others. Therefore for the purpose of the functions, the three functions were divided. 
Brahma is the creator. And the creator should have great intelligence or wisdom. He should know exactly what he is going to create. That intelligence was transformed into Saraswati – that is the power of intelligence. We do imagine that Brahma had a spouse by the name Saraswati, but actually, it is the power of Brahma himself. The power of knowledge of Brahma is Saraswati.
Vishnu is one who sustains. He has to manage. The first is generation-creation, second is organisation or management. For that, the power of illusion is also required. The power of illusion makes you see what is not there and makes you forget what is really there. The power of Vishnu therefore manifested as Lakshmi. It’s a kind of ignorance to think that Vishnu and Lakshmi are husband and wife who live in Vaikuntha. In fact, Lakshmi is nothing but the power of Vishnu – that is the power of illusion. 
The third is the destroyer. Therefore GOD means generation, organisation and destruction. All three together lead to creation, sustenance and annihilation. That which is born has to die. Therefore the final function is of Shiva. Therefore to think that this Maheshwara is the ultimate God is also a kind of ignorance. When we say that Shiva Shakthi, they refer to the primordial God and His power and not Shiva and Parvathi. Shiva and Parvathi are only departmental heads; they are not the primordial God and Goddess The primordial God is the formless God.
In order to carry on the function of annihilation or destruction, came Shiva and Parvathi. In fact, the power of Shiva is Parvathi. Suppose today you have an office, there is a secretary also in the office. And the secretaries are more powerful than the officers themselves. If you want to meet the officer, first you should go to secretary and get the appointment. If you want to worship God, first you should go to the priest. Therefore in order to attain Parameshwara, first you should go Parameshwari or the Goddess. Therefore apart from Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara, 	their powers	manifest themselves as Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvathi.
Many people think they are physical relationships like in the world- that is nothing but reflection of their own relationships or ignorance. It’s a kind of inseparable relationship which is subtle and spiritual and not physical. Therefore the primordial formless God created these three functional heads and gave them the necessary powers in order to do their functions.
Therefore the worship and adoration that we are going to do now is for that primordial God and Goddess, i.e. Shiva and Shakthi and not the Shiva and Parvathi, departmental heads for destruction.
God is not born, does not die and He is there as atma in everybody. Therefore all the worship that we do to Linga is to the original Hiranyagarbha. In the Ati Rudra Maha Yajna also we are worshipping that primordial Hiranyagarbha. Along with that we are also doing Navarathri Homa. And for the sake of this world, this kind of power is very important. The physical power, the mental power and spiritual power- when all the three powers get together, you can achieve anything in this world. In order to achieve even a small task, all these three powers are required.
The physical prowess is Durga; the mental power is Saraswati and spiritual power is Lakshmi. When all these three get together, you can achieve anything in the world. In order to know our real nature also, their grace is very important. That’s why I keep telling you – bend the body, mend the senses, end the mind. In order to do these three things we do need three powers. Even if you want to do service, you need energy and good health. It is not enough you just have physical strength, you also need mental strength.
A king had a servant; what kind of servant was her? He was looking very strong physically but he had no brain. One day the king told the servant, “I am going to sleep now. See that there is no disturbance for my sleep.” And the servant took a sword and was standing. He was having the sword in order to frighten people who came to disturb the king. And then one fly came there. And it was going here and there. With the sword he wanted to drive it away because the master should not be disturbed. Finally this fly went and sat on the nose of the king. And in order to kill the fly, what the servant did was with the sword, he cut the nose of the king. And when you have such a brainless servant that is what is going to happen. Physical strength is not enough; we should have mental strength. Therefore intelligence is also important. And it is Saraswati that grants us that mental power. And Saraswati represents the wisdom of God. Physical strength is not enough, even wisdom is required. Therefore in order to do any kind of service, you do need some intelligence also.
What for are you doing this service? To think that you are serving somebody else is a mistake. God is there in everyone. Therefore we have to think when we serve others, we are serving God Himself. God is there within you. You can also think that I am serving myself. We should not think we are serving somebody else and thereby develop our ego and attachment. And if you want to have that kind of discrimination, you need some spiritual power also. There is only one atma who is the indweller in everybody, There is only one Truth, scholars call it by different names. So in order to develop that kind of discrimination, we need the grace	of Mokshalakshmi. And one who created the universe is Lakshmi, illusion. That is the illusion. In order to remove the illusion, we have to pray to the same Lakshmi. The only God is Truth. In order to get over the illusion in this Creation, we have to pray to that Goddess, Lakshmi. 	
We are worshipping Hiranyagarbha and we are going to identify ourselves with the same primordial Hiranyagarbha; but that is not enough. Only when we get rid of ego and attachment, we can realise God. And in order to get rid of that ego and attachment, you have to do selfless service. In order to do selfless service, all the three powers –physical, mental and spiritual- are required. Therefore it is necessary to worship all these Goddesses.
And we are performing all these yaagas and yajnas with the purpose that everybody should get an opportunity for service and know the ultimately, the Truth and identify themselves with God.
With the grace of the Goddess, we should gain all these three powers and finally realise our own oneness with the Hiranyagarbha. The body is given to us to help others. Why are we doing service? That is our duty. That is our very nature. Helping others is our real nature – that is what we have to do. Para upa kara – para means God; upa means near, proximity; and kara -that which makes you go nearer to God. Paropakara means that which takes us nearer to God. Where is God? God is within you. That which takes you nearer to your own real Self is paropakara. That is merit. The sin is that which takes us away from our true nature. That is why it is said - Helping others is merit and hurting others is sin. All of you have gathered here with great enthusiasm to do service. Just enthusiasm is not enough; you should have the requisite strength also. Definitely it is big great merit for you to take part in the service activities. If I had not willed, none of you could have come here. You should know that because of My Will, all of you have come here. After having come here, you have to put the opportunity to good use. You have to look after everybody with great love. After having spoken so much of philosophy that Hiranyagarbha is God and you criticise others by your side, that is not correct. That only becomes theoretical knowledge; it is not practical knowledge.If you cannot love people who are around us, how can we love God who is far away?  Therefore we have to love God who is in everybody because whomever you salute, the salutation goes to God. If you ridicule anybody, that also goes to God. Sometimes you may get into some difficult situations. The mind also may trouble you at that point of time. In those situations you have to remember what Swami has told you and do what He has told you. ABC means Always Be Careful. Also ABC means Always be Cheerful. If you are careful, you can be cheerful.  When you love everybody and don’t ridicule or blame anybody and serve everybody with love, they will also be cheerful and you will also be cheerful.
Everybody will have at least something of ego and attachment. In order to give it up only we have gathered here. We should not develop our ego and attachment. And the three departments God created in order to carry on the three functions. But even today we find people who worship Shiva they hate people who worship Vishnu; those who worship Vishnu hate people who worship Shiva. Therefore similarly one group of people who are in the transport should not hate kitchen people; kitchen people should not hate serving people.
 All of us together are here in order to materialise the Will of God not our own wishes. So whatever you do, follow your heart. Heart is same and equal for everyone. The heart is always having selflessness. The mind behaves in different ways in different situations.	 You should give up the mind and follow the heart. And he said it is ARMY – A-R-M-Y. And army is there to fight with external people; not within.  The enemies are our own ego and attachment and likes and dislikes; we should not fight among ourselves.
And Shiva has the snake. And Parvathi has a cow. Eshwara has a bull. Gauri-has the gau, cow. That is why she is called Gau-ri.  Karthikeya has a peacock as his vehicle. And for Ganapathy, the vehicle is the very small rat. Shakthi also has the lion. Various kinds of animals are there associated with the family. And if you don’t look after the snake properly, it will swallow the rat. Similarly peacock will kill the serpent. And if you don’t look after lion properly, it will kill the peacock. And they are all enemies when you look at them separately, but together in God’s family, they are all friends.	And the kind of ego and attachment we have is the animal quality. In order to give up our animal qualities and develop divine qualities, we are getting this opportunity.
Earlier many times animals were being sacrificed. It’s a big mistake to think by sacrificing animals, we will get the grace of God. We have to sacrifice our own animal qualities. Yajnam means sacrifice. We have to first sacrifice our ego and attachment. 
I am very happy that all of you have come here with great enthusiasm but you have to share your joy with everyone. You are the limbs and organs of God who is one body. Hands, legs, stomach – all these are organs and limbs. Sometimes the hand may create some trouble to the eye. And many times because of the teeth, the tongue may be hurt. But just because the hand has created some problem for the eye, are you going to cut off your hand? With the same hand, you apply the medicine required for the eye. When you are partaking food sometimes, because of the teeth, tongue may be hurt. We are not going to break our teeth because of that. When we know that everybody is the limb and organ of the same body, we are not going to hate anybody. 
Sometimes there may be some minor differences but when we know that we are all the children of God, servants of God, we can forget those differences. We don’t know how much delight people will derive out of this yajna but first you should derive delight out of this yajna. Whatever you do, do it unitedly and with pure feeling. Don’t have narrow minded differences among yourselves. To think that this is my department, I will confine to this department is wrong; you can serve anywhere and everywhere. Wherever necessary, you can go and do the service. Therefore, accept your responsibilities properly and depending on your capacities, you discharge your duties. 
The day on which Shirdi Baba shed his mortal body was Vijayadashami. And this Vijayadashami marks the transition from Sathya Sai to Prema Sai Avatar. And through Prema Sai Avatar, the Sathya Yuga, the Golden Age will come. This is the first ray of the Golden age. Kali yuga full of darkness of ignorance will end and Sathya Yuga which will be effulgent will start. And within a short time there are going to be many changes in the world. In the same way as when seasons change, some plants will die,  new plants will come up; when this transition happens between Kali Yuga and Sathya yuga also, only those people who are worthy of Sathya Yuga will continue to live, others will have to go. Many people are asking me the question, When will Sathya Yuga begin? I want to tell you from this Vijayadashami, the Sathya Yuga will begin.
It is not just enough the Golden Age dawns; your heart also should change into Satya Yuga. Teachers may teach many lessons; if the students sleep in the class, there is no use. It is not right for you to think when Sathya Yuga dawns, your hearts will be full of love. But in Satya Yuga, if you want to develop noble and good feelings, it will be easy for you. The negativity will reduce; the positivity will increase. When you give up bad company, get into good company; it is easy for us to develop good feelings. Therefore in Sathya yuga, it is easy for us to attain our divinity. But your own effort is also required. If you put in your effort and My Grace also joins that, then you will be able to achieve your goal. You are born for this purpose. The ultimate goal is Self Realisation – to realise our own true Self. When you want to come from Bangalore to Muddenahalli, you come on a road on a car. When road is good, you can go very fast. And when the road is bad, you go slowly. And during the day, you can be fast. When you go in the night, you will go slowly. In Kali yuga if you want to move very fast, it is like a darkness and also a bad road. Sathya Yuga means light and a good road. When both get together, you can move very fast. 
I conclude the Discourse with the blessing that I bless you to realise yourselves 	making	the opportunity given to you to good use.",10/11/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
10,Evening Satsang,"When there is the Wish-fulfilling tree on your yard, why should you look for an 	ordinary tree in your backyard? When you have the Kamadhenu, the wish-fulfilling cow, with you, why should you purchase milk by paying money? When you have right in front of you the Meru parvata or the Meru mountain which is effulgent with the shining of gold and silver, why should you look for gold and silver elsewhere? When you have God with you who will confer on you both devotion and liberation, why would you enter into the worldly pleasures?
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Man is an aspirant of bliss. From birth to death man involves himself in many activities with the sole objective of experiencing bliss. When people eat very delicious food, they say that I experienced Brahmananda. All these pleasures are very limited and they are not infinite like the divine bliss. When man is hungry, he eats food and he is satisfied and experiences some kind of joy. When he eats tasty food, he does experience some kind of joy. But all this is temporary. After the food that you eat is digested, then it won’t be any more joyful. Again hunger arises in your stomach. You lose your joy and you are subjected to hunger which is very sorrowful. In order to get rid of hunger, again you eat food. After eating food, you experience this joy only for a very temporary period. But after some time again you feel hungry and lose all joy. This joy is a temporary pleasure and not permanent bliss. That is why I keep saying, ‘Pleasure is an interval between two pains’. When pleasure goes, you get pain. When pain goes, you get pleasure. Therefore it will be a huge mistake on our part if we struggle only for temporary pleasures.
All kinds of devotees come to God – four kinds of devotees come to God- all are included in these four. 
The first is ‘aarthi’ – this aarthi is one because of either bodily afflictions or other kind of afflictions, he prays to God. Also people perform yajnas, yaagas, and any kinds of adoration and worships in order to gain health. For getting longevity – a longer span of life – people do ‘Ayusha homam.’ All these things are done only keeping in view the body and not the atma. 
The second is ‘arthaarathi’. Definitely there is some kind of solution for people from afflictions but for the arthaarthi, who is greedy after getting more and more wealth, there is no solution at all. If you want to make a peaceful man restless, what you need to do is to just give him 99 rupees. Then for the sake of earning one more rupee, he will be subjected to all kinds of difficulties. He will not be happy having 99 Rupees; he only thinks of one more rupee to make it hundred. For such people, there is no solution at all.
The third is a ‘jignasu’ – a spiritual aspirant. The jignasu has a question. I keep eating food many times a day, I wear all kinds of costumes, also involve myself in many activities but still what pleasure I derive out of them is very temporary. People earn lot of money, purchase lot of things with money but the kind of joy they get is only temporary and it won’t stay permanently. First they purchase a small car and they travel very happily all around the world in that car. But after two children are born, they think that the car is very small, I need a big car and work to get a bigger car. And that way in order to satisfy the endless desires they keep struggling all the time. When you pour ghee into fire, the fire will never be put off; it will only grow. Out of selfishness and self-interest, they involve themselves in many kinds of activities, but they never get permanent joy. The kind of pleasure that we derive will be there for a momentary time and not permanent. Therefore the spiritual aspirant prays with the intention of knowing something which will grant him permanent joy and not temporary pleasure. In order to know the truth, he will perform many sadhanas or spiritual efforts. He only does to know more and more things.
But the highest kind of devotee is the ‘jnani’ or man of wisdom. He believes that God exists. He also knows God exists in everyone. One atma is the indweller in all the beings. He has only one desire and that he wants to experience and realise that kind of God. He won’t have ego and attachments. Like a lotus flower, though it is born in water, it is not immersed in water; similarly the man lives in the world but out of it. He cultivates discrimination and detachment; he has the single, sole desire to experience God. 
Therefore all these devotees come to God. And God gives them whatever they ask for. God tells ‘Yes’ to those people who believe in Him saying yes; He tells ‘No’ to people who do not believe in Him saying no; both ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ are for you, not for Sai; for Sai everything is ‘Yes, Yes, Yes’. God is always ready to satisfy all your desires whatever you ask for. But all these desires should be confined to the four goals of life. The life is to aspire to attain Realisation, earn money through Dharma and then utilise it for service and then attain liberation. There is no problem or no mistake in earning money through Dharma. To the extent that is possible for us we can earn money. But it is a sin to earn money giving up the path of Truth and Righteousness. Therefore Swami keeps telling us what we need God gives but He will not give to satisfy our greed. Because greed has no limit. More and more your earn, your greed keeps growing. When you go to God and ask for material things it is like going to a wish-fulfilling tree, kalpavriksha and asking for coffee powder.
And one day it happened the wife told the husband that his mother-in-law and father-in-law are coming to their home. For husband, when father and mother come there will be no problem but when father-in-law and mother-in-law come, it is a big problem. Therefore wife told the husband, “My father and mother are coming. They love coffee very much. Go and get some good coffee powder.” But he went to every shop but every shop was closed because of some problem. He was frightened thinking if I go back home without coffee powder what his wife would do to him. Then he prayed to the Lord you only have to solve my problem. And if my wife asks for coffee powder and I don’t get it, what greater problem can be there for me? See that is why when there is problem, you think of God. He went on praying sitting in a place. And he saw one great sage going that way. The sage asked this gentleman, “Why are you crying? What is your problem?” He explained, “My wife asked me for coffee powder but all the shops are closed. I don’t know what will happen to me if I go back without the coffee powder to my home.” “My dear, I do understand your problem.” “If you have a good wife, it is life. If you have a bad wife, it is knife.” That hermit explained to him, “Because of this I developed vairagya. I did not become a sanyasi out of love of God but because of detachment from this kind of worldly ambitions. Then the hermit told the husband, “You are very fortunate. You are sitting under this tree. It is not an ordinary tree. It is kalpavriksha itself. Whatever you desire and ask for, the kalpavriksha will give you.” And he was very happy. The husband asked the tree, “If you are really kalpavriksha, wish-fulfilling tree, give me half kilogram of coffee powder.” Immediately a packet of coffee powder fell into his hand. And he was very joyful and went home. 
This is what the situation of the present man is. And people go near God and don’t ask for God, they ask for the world only. When you attain God Himself, will you not get the world? Gaining the proximity of God who can grant us anything, just developing worldly desires is not correct.
We are not performing this yaaga and yagna for some selfish purpose. With the desire for the welfare of everybody in all the worlds, we perform. People involve themselves in all kinds of adorations and worship for their selfish purpose. But very rarely we find people who aspire to attain the world welfare. 
The peace has disappeared and Truth has vanished and the fear of weapons is on the rise; the reason and cause for this tragedy is greed and selfishness. This is the truth which I am telling you. People generally pray for their selfish purposes, for themselves; they don’t pray for everybody. They are all bhogis or pleasure-mongers. But a yogi is one who prays for the welfare of everybody. Because he knows that everybody is the embodiment of God. He won’t have any sense of difference between himself and others. As long as the pot is there, we may think there is space inside and outside the pot - they are different. When the pot of the selfishness breaks, both the spaces become one. Therefore a yogi prays for the welfare of everybody because he knows that everybody belongs to him and they are not ‘other’ people.
What is the difference between Kali yuga and Sathya yuga? Kali yuga is full of selfishness. Selfless time is Sathya yuga. We pray to God for leading us from untruth to truth. And the greatest untruth is to think that this body and selfishness are the Truth. And when you pray for everybody, that is Sathya yuga – Sat yuga. Asat means Kali yuga; Sat means Sathya yuga. When you get rid of our body consciousness and attain Divine Consciousness, then only Kali yuga ends and Sathya yuga begins. Moving from selfishness to selflessness is moving from Kali yuga to Sathya yuga. 
All of us get together, perform this yajna with praise to God that everybody in all the worlds should be happy, that is why Kali Yuga will end and Sathya Yuga will begin. 
Where is happiness? Happiness is not in the worldly pleasures. They are only pleasures - there is no happiness. Happiness in union with God. True happiness means that everybody should realise their divine nature and enjoy bliss. That is why we are performing this yajna.
All of you come and participate with that kind of broadmindedness and enjoy divine bliss.

11,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 1 Discourse,"In the same way as a reflection does not stick to the mirror, in the same way as drops of water will not stick to the lotus leaves, sins will not stick to a man or woman with devotion. Both birth and death are behind you all the time. This Creation -the heart of Creation, the vehicle of Creation - runs on the two wheels of birth and death. If one of the wheels falls away, the Creation itself would stop. That is the secret of this Creation. 
Embodiments of Divine Atma!
For every man who is born on this earth, death is inescapable. Birth and death: they live together- and that is what drives this universe. In the same way as night follows the day and day follows the night, birth follows death and death follows birth. The scriptures reveal that this is nothing but the bondage that binds us to this chakra. 
The world is nothing but reflection, reaction and resound. For every action, there is a reaction. Whatever we think, whatever we say, whatever we do, definitely there will be a reaction for that. Because of this reaction, the impact of the consequences of our own actions will work. If we want to cross over this law of karma – action and reaction – you have to transform all your actions as yajna.
O Man! Is it possible for you to cross over this law of karma or action and reaction – whether you study many scriptures, you go to forests, and you do all kinds of spiritual practices – is it possible for you to cross over this law? If you take a vessel –whether it is a small well or the limitless ocean – the quantity of water you can carry is limited. Is it possible for anyone to cross over this law of karma? Definitely there is a consequence for every action that we involve in. In this land of actions - karma, we do keep involving ourselves in many kinds of activities. If we want to attain liberation, is it possible?
Because action and reaction come one after the other all the time, it is very difficult for us to cross over this law. Because of one action, there is one reaction. Because of the reaction, another action starts. The whole life we lead because of this action and reaction. If we don’t want to get any reaction for your action, what is that you have to do? When you transform all your karmas or actions into karma yoga, only then the actions will not result in any reactions.
 Yoga is perfection in action. Whatever you do, if you do it perfectly, that action will not create any reaction. What is karma yoga? When you perform all your actions for the love of God, all your actions will turn into karma yoga. Whatever actions you involve in, whatever yajna you perform, whatever you eat when you offer everything to Me, then the karma yoga will come. You offer it to Me. When we do all our actions with the love for God, the reactions will not haunt us.
What do you mean by yaaga or yajna? Is it just offering some offering into the fire? They are only an external activity that you involve yourself in – in fact, they cannot cleanse your heart. All the activity we undertake to put time to good use but if that activity does not clean our hearts, then it becomes useless. Purity of mind is very important. It is yoga which grants us chitta shuddhi or purity of mind. Therefore whatever we think, whatever we say, whatever we do, when we offer it with love for God that will become karma yoga. 
Spirituality is not complex or complicated. It is very, very easy. Whatever you do you offer it for the love of God and also give up the desire for the result of the action that becomes karma yoga. On one hand, you offer all the activities with love for God. On the other hand, you just sacrifice the desire for the results of action. When we do all this sincerely, the actions will not end in reactions. Whatever we want to offer to God, naturally we want that activity to be perfect. We are not going to offer rotten things to God. We offer to God only that which is pure. True yajna and yaaga is when whatever we think, whatever we say and whatever we do, we do it with love for God and offer it to God – that becomes the yaaga or yajna. When you write an address on the postal cover, the postman will deliver it only to that address; similarly on all your actions you write – address it to - Krishnarapanamastu – I offer it to Krishna- it goes to Krishna.
 But many people who are narrow-minded, who think wrongly, they try to escape from the reactions of actions when they do wrong things.  When they do good things, they take the credit for themselves; they say, “I am only doing it.” When they do wrong things they will offer it to God.
Once there was an argument between a husband and a wife. Their son, having obtained great expertise in games, he went, won some match somewhere and brought the prize home. Father came back from the office. The son went to the father in order to tell him that I have won a prize. And mother also followed him. With great pride the son told his father, “I have won this big prize.” And the husband said very proudly, “Look at this, Kamala! My son has won such a wonderful prize. Because he is my son he has been able to win all these prizes.” The wife asked the husband, “You are telling that the boy has won prizes in sports because he is your son. But have you looked at his progress report? He has secured zeros in every subject.” Then the husband told the wife, “It is because he is your son he has secured zero marks in every subject. You don’t have any brain and your son also does not have a brain.” Look at this because of selfishness how a person changes his voice. 
When somebody good things and he wants good results, he keeps on telling, “I have done this good act.” And when they do something wrong they say all this happened because of God’s Will and this is God’s Will that this has happened. It is a kind of treachery. Only a sincere person will get the wisdom. When you do something with insincerity and ostentation, He will not accept your offering. When you make all your actions sacred and offer them with love to God, then karma becomes karma yoga. 
This yajnas and yaagas are very essential. It is our culture. Even if a boy has his birthday, he will go to parents seeking blessings. Parents will bless their son. Not only that, they will also give him gifts which he likes. They do it in order to demonstrate their love for the son. Such customs and traditions we do practise. And in Indian culture, yaagas and yajnas are very noble activities.
What we think exists, really does not exist. What we think does not exist, really exists. What exists is God everywhere, at all times. This is the word of Sai – the path of Truth. Energy becomes matter and matter becomes energy.
It is written in the Taittiriya Upanishad - it is said from the space came the wind; from the wind came fire; from fire came water; from water came earth. All these five have very subtle relationships among themselves. Akasha does not get translated properly when you refer to it as space. It is not space – it is a kind of vibration. The primordial vibration that emanated is Om. It is also referred to as the Naadabrahma. Because of the vibration of the sound of God – i.e. Om- the breeze started blowing. You have seen a music programme here. The veena produces melodious music because of the vibration or movement. When the sound of vibration happens in the akasha, there comes the wind. There is an inseparable relationship between wind and fire. If there is no wind, there cannot be any fire. If you see a fire, it means wind is also there. That is why fire came from the wind. From fire came water. When you heat water, water gives up its form and becomes water vapour. When the water vapour loses its fire of heat, then it becomes water again. Because of fire, water becomes vapour; vapour becomes water. That is why it is said that water emanated from fire. Fire means heat. And when water became still cooler, it became solid earth.  That is how from the space emanated, evolved the earth. 
In every human personality there are these five elements. Therefore whatever happens in the akasha, that will affect the other four elements also. Akasha – space - is full of vibrations. When you chant a mantra, the whole space or akasha will be filled with sacred vibrations. These vibrations pervade everyone present there and make the sacred feelings emanate in their personalities. The heaviest is the earth. Vibrations do not have any weight or mass. The heavy matter can move only a little distance; later on it stops. But vibrations which do not have any weight they can reach anywhere. We chant the mantras here and the vibrations will pervade the whole universe. Veda mantra has such potency or power.
 But today’s Indians have forgotten their own Indian culture. We are rejecting our own culture and we are not trying to protect that culture but we are accepting alien cultures in our country. All cultures are no doubt good – we have to accept only good things in all cultures and give up the wrong things in all cultures. But in our culture, the place of God is very, very high and very important.
It is also a mistake on our part to think that God has a name and a form. He is formless. But the formless God comes down in many names and forms to move among His devotees. Sweets are different, but sugar is one and the same. Some children may like mysorepak; and some children like gulab jamoon and some other children like jilebi; all these sweets may have different forms but the sweetness in all of them is one and the same. Whether you worship Rama or Krishna or Shiva, all are equal. In the same way as there is one sweetness in all the sweets, one divine principle is there in all the names and forms of God. 
We can’t call it a religion. It is a way of life. That is the ancient dharma. Sanathana dharma does not have any beginning or end or even the middle. What is Sanathana dharma? Sanathana dharma is the atma dharma because atma is the eternal which will never be born and never dies. But we are sacrificing, giving up, this oneness of all Creation and we are dividing ourselves in the names of religions, castes and languages. But God comes down again and again in order to establish dharma. That is why I aspire that we will have these yajnas and yaagas and also teach you these basics of Sanathana dharma. 
Ramayana or Bhagavatha are very sacred scriptures – our children should learn all of them. Baagavathamu means in Telugu word means ‘Bhagavavathamu’ means we will become good. If you study Bhaagavatha, you will become good. The first letter, ‘Bha’ stands for Bhakthi, devotion; ‘Ga’ is jnana – wisdom; ‘va’ means vairagyam – detachment; ‘tha’ means the thattva or the fundamental principle; ‘mu’ means mukthi or liberation. When you study Bhaagavatham you get all these five. 
Children should listen to all this with sincerity. Not only just listen. They should also contemplate and practise. When you try to understand these divine principles, your efforts will find fulfilment. But our school children are very, very sincere. Whatever is said to them, with great sincerity they will try to understand and try to practice.
In another school – not our school- a teacher was teaching Ramayana to the children. And when he was teaching Ramayana, the school inspector came into the classroom. And he asked the students, “What are you studying?” All of them together said, “We are studying Ramayana.” The inspector asked them, “Who wrote Ramayana?” The boy was frightened and said, “Sir, I did not write Ramayana.” And then the boy said, “May be the teacher is teaching us Ramayana; probably he only wrote.” Teacher was also afraid. He said, “I did not write the Ramayana. Principal may have written the Ramayana. Principal has commanded me to teach you Ramayana; probably he has written Ramayana.” All the three of them approached the Principal and asked him, “Who wrote Ramayana?” He was also frightened and said, “I did not write. Probably the Education department people have written this Ramayana.” 
We have forgotten the great scripture of our own land and we are subjected to total ignorance. But our children are not like that. The students and teachers get together in order to rejuvenate Indian culture.
And they are saying that from Kali yuga we are getting changed into Sathya yuga. What is this Kali yuga? Selfishness is Kali yuga. Selflessness is Sathya yuga. When you give up your selfishness and self-interest and become selfless, then Kali yuga will change into Sathya yuga.
Sacrifice is not giving up wife and children and going away to the forest; real sacrifice is giving up your selfishness. When we give up selfishness and self-interest, we ourselves will get transformed into men of sacrifice. Because of the obstacles of the Kali yuga, when we want to practise spirituality, there are many problems. In Sathya yuga, when you want to practise spirituality, it becomes very easy for you. In a classroom all the children are very disciplined and completely silent, teacher will be able to do his job very well, perfectly. But on the other hand if the students are moving here and there without concentration, then the teacher cannot help. In Kali yuga there are lot of disturbances. Whatever is said, they are not able to follow it properly. Even if they wish to practise everything correctly, there are many obstacles on the path. When Kali yuga ends and Sathya yuga comes, everybody will be able to develop spiritual feelings, practise spirituality very easily and derive divine bliss therefrom.
We have organised this program in order to end Kali yuga and bring in Sathya yuga. Only when you give up your selfishness and self-interest, you can definitely enjoy the benefits of Sathya yuga. There may be sunrise but if you are still sleeping, it is still night for you. Even if Sathya yuga comes, if you are not able to give up your selfishness and narrow-mindedness, you will continue to live in Kali yuga. 
I bring My discourse to a close aspiring that all of you will develop sacred feelings, give up wrong feelings and also invite and welcome the Sathya yuga and enjoy the benefits. In the next ten days I want to tell you many more things; if you have got any doubts and questions, if you give them to me, I will be able to clarify them.",10/13/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
12,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 2 Discourse,"One may attain complete scholarship over many subjects and conquer the audience through oratory; one may be a great warrior fighting battles and winning them; one may be born as an emperor and a king and rule over kingdoms; one may give thousand cows in charity; one may count all the stars in the sky; one may also name all the species of life; one may even go to the moon but can anyone control his mind and senses and become totally selfless and stay blissful within oneself?
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Man is able to conquer external victories to a great extent; even he has set his foot on the orb of the moon; but is he able to go at least one inch inside himself? No, it is not possible for him. Without knowing the Truth, all the time he is going outwards to conquer things in the world which are absolutely temporary but he does not investigate even for a moment what is permanent and try to pursue that. 
Run away from bad company; get into good company; all the time involve yourself in discriminating between what is permanent and what is temporary; and day and night involve yourself in noble and sacred activities. Giving up those things which are eternal and permanent, all the time he is utilising all his energies to go after things in the outside world which are absolutely transient and temporary. 
What is the cause of this kind of total ignorance? The root cause of all ignorance is body consciousness. When one thinks he is this body and mind, he is subjected to the misery of pursuing things in the external world. When man is born, he comes out lamenting, crying. And even when he leaves the world, he goes out crying and lamenting. But even in the middle between birth and death in his life, all the time he is grieving and never enjoying or enjoying any delight or joy. When he is born, he asks the question, “Koham? Who am I?” When you listen to the cry of the just-born babies, we listen to the word ‘Koham’ which means ‘Who am I?’ The baby is born with the question ‘Who am I’? We, the parents, tell the child that you are so-and-so, these are your parents but without telling him that you are already liberated, you are all the time the very the embodiment of bliss of and purity. All the time we keep telling the child that this is your body and this is your family and tell him all kinds of untruths and make him believe that they are the truths. The child hears these untruths any number of times; therefore, he also thinks that untruth is the truth. 
But all the time God cautions the man through his inhalation and exhalation all the time. God is giving the answer to the question, ‘Who am I’ – that you are ‘Soham’ – ‘I am He’. ‘Koham’ means ‘Who am I’? ‘Soham’ means ‘I am Himself’. It is said ‘Wisdom itself is God’; and ‘This world itself is atma’; ‘You are That’; ‘I am God’. In the Vedas there are these great declarations – the Mahavakyas in the Vedas. We don’t tell him these four great declarations to our children; instead of that we tell them, “You are this body. This is your name. You belong to this family. This is what you have to achieve.” All the time telling him all the untruths we are spoiling his mind. The child is born absolutely pure and sacred, but we people make it unsacred, impure by telling him all kinds of untruths. The truth is you are not the body, body is yours; you are not the mind, the mind is yours; you are the atma. In the Vedas they declare ‘Ayam Atma’. Even in English, we can say, “I am atma.” Whichever language – our language or English language- the truth is one and the same. Since we involve ourselves with the body and the senses, we are wasting our life always believing the untruth. 
There is a simple story in the Upanishads.	.  		
A lion cub, even at birth it was separated from its mother; it was roaming around aimlessly in a forest; finally found a flock of sheep and started living with them. Though it was a lion because it was in the company of the sheep, this lion cub started behaving like a sheep. Sheep are always full of fear; therefore all the time they move about in a group or a flock, they will not move alone. One day when this the lion cub was roaming around with the sheep, it heard the roaring of a lion. Once the sheep heard the roaring of the lion, the sheep started running away. But lion cub was very curious to know where was that roar coming from. He wanted to know that.  “I have never heard such amazing, wonderful voice. Where is it coming from? I should know where that roar is coming from.” Therefore he ran in the opposite direction of the sheep.	But sheep had a big leader. The leader of the sheep called this lion cub and asked the question, “Where are you going?”“Such a wonderful roar I never heard. I want to know where it is coming from.” “That is the roar of a lion. You should not go there. It is dangerous for you. Therefore you come back with us.” But lion cub said, “I am not going to come with you. I want to know the source of this roar.” And he went in the opposite direction. The sheep left the lion cub to itself and they went in the opposite direction. After some time this lion cub saw the lion.  That big lion looked at the lion cub and was amazed to see it there. “What are you doing with the sheep?” “I am also a lamb therefore I am moving around with the sheep.” The lion said, “You are a lion cub.” “I am a lamb of a sheep. I am also bleating like a sheep. I am also eating grass like a sheep. I am also a sheep.” But lion told him, “It is because of the mistake of the company of the sheep, you are behaving like a sheep. You are not a sheep.” 
Tell me your company, I will tell you what you are. If you are in the company of the fools, you will also become a fool. Therefore, we should get into the company of scholars and also good and sacred people.	That is why you should run away from bad company and get into good company. From good company you get into detachment. 
Then when the lion cub met the big lion, lion told him, “You are also a lion. Because you don’t see yourself therefore you are not able to recognise who you are.” The big lion took the lion cub to a river and said, “	I will show you your form.” The lion cub saw its own reflection in clear water and was wondering, surprised what it is. With little effort, the lion cub also could roar. Then the lion cub realised that it was a lion and not a sheep.
Because we believe that we are the body, for the sake of the body we keep doing everything. In such a situation, God comes down as an Avatar or an incarnation and He roars like a lion and reminds the human beings that they are also divine.
 There is only one atma which is the resident of the hearts of all beings. Every being has My as part and parcel in it. This whole world is enveloped in God. All that you see, all that you do is divine and divine - that is what the divine incarnation teaches you. As is the feeling, so does it happen. Dust you think, dust you are; God you think, God you are. Dust, when gets into the company of water, it goes down- it can’t go up. But dust in the company of wind, it goes upwards. When you have good company, you also develop good thoughts. Therefore the ABC of life is Avoid Bad Company. Always Be Careful. If you are always careful, you will Always Be Cheerful. Therefore good company is important.

It is My desire, why I organise such a big function is, I want that all of you get into good company. From good company, you develop detachment. And from detachment you give up all bondage to the world. When you give up bondage to the world, you will become steady in your mind. From there you gain liberation. 
But My dears, by just getting into good company, it is not enough.  It is not enough if you listen to what happens in this good company. It is necessary that you contemplate on what you have heard. Even contemplation is not enough. You also have to practise and experience it. If you don’t practise, it is useless. I have been always telling you, ‘You are the embodiment of God; you are the embodiment of love; you are the embodiment of peace.’ Only when you develop love for divinity or God, you can control your body and senses.
In a satsang like this, somebody like Badri was very well expounding Bhagavatham. All the people hearing to the exposition of Bhagavatham, were very delighted. But only an old woman was crying, shedding tears. And looking at the tears of that old lady, this Bhagavatha who was expounding Bhagavatham was very happy. He saw the old lady crying and that thought she was a great devotee shedding tears of joy listening to his exposition of Bhagavatham.  Those days the kind of books we have were not there. And the Bhagavatham was written on palm leaves and tied with a black thread. And that black thread was binding these palm leaves. This Bhagavatha went to that old lady and asked her, “You like this Bhagavatham exposition so much. And you are shedding tears of joy.” That old lady said, “Master, I don’t know what is Bhagavatham or the story of Bhagavatham.” She said, “I have lost my husband recently. When I see the black thread on the palm leaves of your Bhagavatham, I remember the black thread on the waist of my husband. That’s why I am crying.” 
What is the use of going to such satsangs? 
Satsang means not just listening and forgetting what we listen to; we need to contemplate and also practise. Starting with good company, we can reach the ultimate destination of liberation. Therefore when you change your company, your thoughts also will change.
Whether it is Ati Rudra Maha Yajna or Navarathri Homa or Durga Puja, all of them are responsible for giving you a satsang or good company and there is no other purpose	. All the five senses should merge into this program. When all the five senses are focussed in this program, they also get merged into divinity.
‘Shabda’ or sound is listening. You are listening to the sound of the veda chanting and also Bhagavatham exposition. Touch or ‘Sparsha’ means the kind of offerings you put into the fire or doing ‘namaskar’ – prostration – all this refer to ‘sparsha’. Seeing such a wonderful, sacred, beautiful yajna itself is the vision. And ‘rasa’ means tasting – not exactly the prasadam that is sweet, you should also enjoy the sweetness of the bhakthi rasa or the devotion. ‘O tongue! Drink the juice and nectar of devotion.’ And finally, smell, fragrance – ‘gandha’. The fragrance that arises in the yajna also gets into our body and purifies our body and mind. And it is my purpose when you get into a yajna, all the five senses get purified and become sanctified because all the focus is on the divinity. Therefore you come here to enjoy in the presence of the yajna, but keep your mind somewhere else, is not correct. 
Wherever the body is, there should be the mind and heart- that is what is concentration. And from concentration you go to contemplation i.e. ’mananam’. And finally we go from contemplation to meditation – that is ‘nidhidhyasana’. When you make your mind steady and purify it, only then you can see God. Where there is clear and steady water, you can look at your own reflection very well. But in dirty water which is always moving full of waves, you cannot see anything – your own reflection. The big lion could take the lion cub and showed his own reflection in the clear water; then he realised the truth. The mind is also like the water. When the mind is steady and pure, even the sky gets reflected in that. Only in that reflection you can also realise you are not this body; you are the atma. Because of the worldly desires, the clear water is getting polluted. The body is also moving hither and thither; therefore the mind also becomes fickle. You can’t see your own reflection. Therefore in the muddy water which is all the time moving, you cannot see your own reflection. 
Everyone is all the time asking Me, “Swami, if you are here, I should be able to see you, I should be able to talk to you.” But what effort you are putting in to realise your desire? In the same way as sky gets reflected in pure and steady water, only in pure and steady mind God gets reflected. And the whole world may be there but a blind person cannot see anything. Because of the worldly desires, mind becomes blind. Dual mind is half blind. If you want both world and God together, it is not possible. You won’t get anything. When somebody like Prahlada prayed to God, “I want only God,” when he attained God, he attained the world also. If we get God, it is good enough. God is object, God is real; the world is its shadow. Depending on the position of the sun, the shadow keeps diminishing and growing; but the object remains same. Subjected to the constraints of space, time and causation, the mind - the world - keeps changing all the time; nothing is steady, Only God is permanent and eternal.
Suppose I come here and call all the people to listen to My discourse, how many people will come? But when we perform Ati Rudra Maha Yajna and other homas, people want to see and enjoy; that’s why everybody joins here. We are doing this Ati Rudra Yajna to get rid of the misery. Attachment is responsible for the misery. Body consciousness is responsible for attachments. We are arranging this programme so that you get rid of attachments and develop devotion. Attachment to God is good; attachment to the world is not good. 
‘Ruk’ means crying or sorrow or misery. One who destroys this misery is Rudram. Where is this misery? It is in our attachment. Attachment is responsible for all our sorrows. Mind has to get attached to something or the other. If mind gets attached to the world, it can’t get attached to God. In a vessel there can be water or air – both cannot co-exist. When your mind is filled with God, you will not have body consciousness. When you have body consciousness, you can’t have divine consciousness. All of us have gathered here in order to listen to the art of controlling the body and senses and make the mind inward. We want to make our minds steady and pure. In that steady, pure mind, God also manifests. When you offer all your evil, all your selfishness, all your desires into the sacred fire and develop devotion, that is the goal of this yajna.
There are eleven Rudras or ekadasha Rudras- ten senses and one mind together. We have to offer all this into the sacred fire of the Ekadasha Rudra yajna. Only then we can develop divine consciousness and get rid of body consciousness. Therefore all of you should utilise this opportunity to good use and derive bliss.
My Blessings, My Grace is there on everyone in bountiful. Even for arranging this yajna here, one family is doing so much of sacrifice, even selling their properties – you have to understand the sacredness and purity. They don’t want any properties; they want only proper-ties. And they are all doing all this to develop the proper relationship with God.
And even the Pradhana Acharya, the main priest of this yajna, Nanjunda Dikshitar’s daughter’s heart surgery is taking place. And even the surgeons are waiting without surgery. But because of blood pressure and sugar, they did not start the surgery. It’s a bypass surgery. And now what I have done is I have passed the surgery itself. No surgery is required. Because of the sacrifice he made and the merit that he earned, his daughter will gain good health. Because of the sacrifice he did, he will also get yoga or combination with God – union with God. Happiness is union with God. Because of that service-mindedness and sacrifice, definitely the yajna will find its fulfilment.
You are participating in this yajna – you should know that you are very fortunate. Also we have to understand, realise that one who is doing this offering is also Brahma, offering itself is Brahma, sacrificial fire is also Brahma; one who enjoys this is also Brahma – everything is God. 
I bring the discourse to a close by blessing you that all of you should realise only God is the eternal truth and this world is an illusion and derive divine bliss.",10/14/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
13,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 3 Discourse,"Whoever thinks of Me without thinking of anything else, such people are always devoted to Me; I will look after their welfare.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Lord Sri Krishna gave us this word – “Whoever thinks of Me all the time without thinking of anything else, I will look after, every day, his welfare. Whoever thinks of Me all the time at all places, I will grant him all the gifts of this world and also the other world.”
‘Yogakshema’ or welfare does not mean that God gives us all wealth and treasures, name and fame, which are only worldly. All of them are related to activity and not to union with God. Real ‘yogakshema’ means that “I will drive away all the darkness of ignorance from My devotee, grant him the experience of the divine self, granting him the divine bliss.” 
When there is the wish-fulfilling tree right in front of your home, why do you look for the plantain trees in your backyard? When there is Kamadhenu, the wish-fulfilling cow which grants you milk whenever you ask it, why do you want to purchase a cow paying money? Right in front of you there is the Meru mountain which is full of effulgence of gold and silver, then why do you want to purchase gold and silver from a market? When you have God right in front of you who will grant you both bhakthi and mukthi –devotion and liberation – why is it you going after the worldly pleasures and worldly experiences?
It is total ignorance you go to a Kalpavriksha or the wish-fulfilling tree or Kamadhenu, the wish-fulfilling cow and ask for coffee powder. Similarly, it is absolutely no wisdom on the part of human beings to go after the reflection, shadow and illusion giving up the object. We need to put in effort and work hard to attain something which is permanent, which is eternal, which grants us everything.
Bhagavad Gita says that this world is full of sorrow and also temporary. If worldly pleasures can give us complete happiness, why is it we get again and again subjected to misery and sorrows? With great effort you attain one thing and for some time you are happy, but after some time that happiness disappears and you are miserable. Again you go after something else which you think will grant you complete happiness, you attain it, but even that is also very temporary and transient; again you get subjected to sorrow. In this dual world which is full of happiness and sorrow, profit and loss, gain and pain, you cannot get something which can give you complete happiness. You have to look for total infinite bliss only in a place where it is existing not in a place where it is not existing.
A dog which was very hungry went after food; finally found a small bone and it was very happy. It was a dry bone. It thought it is going to derive great joy from that bone and went on chewing that bone. And when it was chewing the bone, a small piece of the bone hurt its jaw. It never experienced or felt that its gums were hurt but went on chewing again and again. Bleeding started from the wound caused by the bone in the gums. But dog was enjoying thinking that that pleasure and joy of blood was coming from the bone and continued to chew the bone. And it so happened dog thought that blood was coming from the bone and not from its own gums. But what is the truth? It is total ignorance for the dog to think that that blood or the happiness was coming from somewhere else exactly when it was deriving that blood only from its own body. 
Similarly man goes in search of joy and bliss in many places. But his very form and embodiment is bliss. Being himself the embodiment of bliss, he looks for joy and bliss elsewhere, puts in great effort to attain that joy and all his life is wasted in this kind of effort. It is all a useless activity - you look for something without knowing where exactly it is available.
There was an old woman who lost her needle and was she searching for it everywhere. When the sun set, night descended, she went outside and started looking for the needle outside the house. Wherever she searched, she could not get it. There was a good person who saw this and asked the old woman, “What is that you are searching for?” The old woman said, “My dear son, I lost a needle. That is what I am searching.” Even that person said that I am going to help you and he also started searching for the needle. And both of them searched for a very long time. Another very intelligent person came there and asked them, “What is it that you are searching for?” That gentleman said, “This old woman has lost her needle. I am helping her to find the needle. Along with her, I am also searching.” Then this intelligent person asked them, “Where did you lose your needle?” She said, “I lost it in my house.” “When you have lost the needle inside the home, and now you are looking for it on the street, how can you get it?” “There is complete darkness in my house, there is no light; here under the street light, I have lot of light. That is why I am looking for it here.”
You can see that it is ignorance. Is it right that you have lost the needle inside the home and you go outside under the street light and look for it? You will get it only when you look for it where it is. And it is total ignorance for you having the treasure of bliss within yourself, you look for it somewhere outside. There are lot of people - they are looking for things which they have kept on their own head. It is complete ignorance to look for something which is not there.
And you are the very embodiment of bliss, you are the embodiment of atma; you have to find it within yourself and is it possible for you to find it somewhere else? We study all the scriptures, we listen to lot of lectures; in spite of having that knowledge, why is it that we are not able to find it? There are three obstacles – ‘mala’, ‘vikshepa’, ‘aavarana’. 
‘Mala’ means impurities. Selfish desires are the impurities within us. Being enveloped in body consciousness, always thinking of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ and developing selfish desires, that is impurity or ‘mala’. Because of the impurities, you are not able to see what is really existing. In a room there is a mirror. If you want to look at your reflection in the mirror, first you have to remove the dust on the mirror. Only when you remove the dust, you can see your own reflection in the mirror. Because of the dust of impurities you are not able to see your own reflection in the mirror; you are looking for your reflection elsewhere in all other places. 
The second is ‘vikshepa’. In darkness you look at a rope and you are afraid that it is a serpent. Because of the darkness you don’t see what really exists; you think something exists which is not really there. When you light the lamp of wisdom in your heart, you can see what is temporary and what is permanent. Wisdom is seeing the unity of all Creation. When you put on the light of wisdom in the room you can see your reflection in the mirror. But because there is no light, you think that you are looking at somebody else’s reflection and therefore you are scared. But when you put on the light and look at our own reflection in the mirror, we feel very happy.
You have removed the dust on the mirror, you have put on the light but still you do not see your reflection because of the cover on the mirror. Because of the cover on the mirror you are not able to see your own the reflection. 
When you remove the cover, remove the dust, put on the light then you can see your own reflection in the mirror and derive great joy. Ego is that impurity, attachment is the darkness. When we get rid of body consciousness by removing ego and attachments, then definitely we can know our own Truth. 
If we think when we get old we go into satsang or good company, listen to the Truth and lectures and learn, that is a mistake. Many young people think this is the time for us to earn money, develop our family, enjoy pleasures of the world; only when you get old, you can get into satsangs and listen to spiritual talks. Young people say, “Now I am very busy with my lot of activity and duties; when I get old and get retired, then let me get into the satsangs.” But when you get old, you can’t listen because your ears are not helping you, you can’t see properly, you can’t sit straight. And because you are not able to sit steadily for some time, you are not able to get into satsangs; you just sit at home.
There was a miserly person like this. He does not do anything that is required at home also. He does not spend. The roof on the house was ruined. Therefore, during the rain, water was leaking into the house. Because of the rain, water was leaking and he could not sit or stand anywhere; he was in a corner. He was spending all the time sitting in the corner. Many friends came to him and told him, “Why not you spend some money and repair the roof so that there is no water leakage?” He replies, “Now in the rainy season there is no use repairing the roof. Let me do it when the rain stops.” When the rainy season stopped, the friends came again and told him, “Now that there is no rain better you repair your roof so that you will be happy during the rainy season.” But he is a miser. He is telling, “Now there are no rains. What is the use of repairing the roof now?”
When you are children, you are enjoying only in play and games.  When you are young, you go after worldly pleasures. When you are old, all the time you are immersed in miseries. Nobody is interested in God. 
When you are young, when your head, heart and hands are very strong, you have to utilise the time well, get into satsangs, learn good things and you can derive great joy.
Many people may ask the question, “Why is Swami wasting so much money on yaagas and yajnas? Should he not use that money on some service project?	Also they ask the question, “Very valuable, precious things He is putting it into the fire and wasting them; He is not giving it to any poor people.” The kind of people who say that – looking at their lives, Swami says, “The way you are looking at my yajna and sorrowing over it, I feel very sad about your own lives.”
After having got this precious human birth, living like animals, is not the right thing. Among all species of life, human birth is very rare. Out of 84 lacs of species of life, human birth is the greatest and the highest. Even after knowing this truth, you are behaving like animals – you are not really behaving like humans. Food, sleep, procreation and fear are common to both animals and men. Only wisdom separates human beings and animals. Human beings without wisdom are equal to animals.
When somebody asks you the question, “Who are you,” you say, “I am man.” To say that “I am man” is only half truth – that it is not complete truth. The compete truth is – “I am man, I am not an animal.” All the animal instincts are also there in human beings. Desire, anger, greed, infatuation, pride and jealousy – all the six qualities are there in both. Living our lives for the sake of fulfilling these desires is animal life, not human life. 
In the words ‘manava’ there is the meaning that you are not new. You are the ancient one. You don’t have any beginning or end or the middle. The body is born and body dies; how can it become permanent? When you realise the atma principle knowing that everything else is transient and temporary, only then you can enjoy true bliss in your lives. For all the sorrows and attachments, the root cause is to have the sense of difference – I am different, he is different – that is also a kind of ignorance.
It is also a mistake to think that I am serving somebody else. A lot of students and young men and young women are here for serving. To think that we are serving somebody else is a mistake. The right thing is to consider that I am serving God who is in every body, I am serving God who is in myself. When your hand puts water into your mouth, that is not service. If the mouth sends the water to the stomach, it is not service. It is only a duty, not a service.  We should know that we are doing our duty thinking that we are doing service and become very proud and arrogant is not correct. 
Why are we serving? We are doing service in order to get rid of ego and attachment within us. If you develop your ego doing service that is not the right thing. How can you judge whether you are doing the service properly or not? We should know that only when your ego and attachment are on the decline, you are doing service properly. And the purohits who have come here, with great sincerity they are performing all these yaagas and yajnas. But they are not ‘purohitas’, they should become ‘parahitas’ – those who help others. This body is given to us to serve others. The purpose of the body is to help others. The body is the basis of all noble activity. And using the body only for service is the real thing, otherwise you use it for any other activity, it is a waste of time.
When some people think that Swami is wasting all the precious material, putting it into the fires, looking at you, I feel very sad that you are wasting your precious life. I feel very sad that when you have got the precious human birth leading an animal life and wasting it, is a matter of great sorrow for Me. I am arranging all these satsangs so that you can give up all the wrong, evil thoughts and evil feelings and develop good, noble feelings. From good company, you develop detachment; from detachment you get over bondage; when you get over bondage, you become steady, and then you get liberation. Whatever you do, offer it to God for love of God.
Today you listened to the story of Bhagavatha. But this young man had 103 degrees fever this morning. And he was feeling very bad whether he could continue to deliver his talk. But only one thing he thought about. When Swami was many times very ill and he was undergoing lot of pain also, He never said ‘No’ to anybody. When lot of people did padanamasakaars, they were surprised to look at the Feet.		
Many people would ask the question to Swami, “When you are having such high fever, why do you come and grant darshan?” I had only one answer for them, “This body has come for removing the ills of mankind. The body is the basis of all good activity. This body is given for helping others. Using the body for any other activity other than helping others is not right. Having got that precious human birth, it is very necessary and essential that you put it to good use.” 
It is also a mistake to think even if I lose this body, I will get another body in the next life. The body has five sheaths – food sheath, life sheath, mind sheath, intelligence sheath and bliss sheath. The gross body is the food sheath of the human personality. Only when the life gets into this, the inert becomes full of life. Otherwise it is inert and it is not conscious. Because of the life sheath, the food sheath also can move around. When the electric current flows, the lights will shine and fans will rotate. Similarly when the life principle enters the inert body, it starts working. But at death, life principle leaves the inert body and goes away. You have lost only the gross body and not the mind. The subtle body is having this life principle, the mind principle and intelligence principle. Even the subtle body has ego and attachment. At death, what you leave is only the physical, gross body. Only when you get another gross and physical body, you can look for liberation.
 If you want to crossover a river you need a boat; in order to cross over this ocean of samsara, you also need this body. Boat can move in water but water should not get into the boat. And the water gets into the boat, the boat will drown. You can live in samsara but samsara should not get into you. You will be happy and secure as long as this worldliness does not get into your mind.
With physical eyes we can see 84 lacs of species of life but there are many things which are invisible; you can’t see with your eyes. They are subtle and energy forms. You think that Shiva and Parvathi are in Kailasa. If you go to Kailasa can you see them? They are all in subtle bodies. When you want to offer something to Shiva and Parvathi who are in subtle form, you also have to convert the material into subtle form.
When you put gross offerings into fire, fire converts this gross into subtle. Subtle will get into the subtle and the gross will get into the gross. The fruit that we eat today, tomorrow it becomes excreta. But in between we get the subtle strength from the fruit into our body. Therefore in food there is the gross form of the food and also the subtle juice or the strength.
Since ancient times we have been worshipping God and offering Him food. Then why are you offering food to God who is not seen in the body? Are you able to see whether that God is having a mouth and a stomach? Are you seeing the food going into the stomach? The fire of hunger in our stomach digests food and takes the subtle strength from the food. Similarly when you offer gross objects into the fire in the homa kunda, it transforms into subtle and sends it to the subtle forms of God.
And He is the very form of the essence. He is actually taking up that subtle energy from every gross thing. When you write a letter, write an address on the postal envelope and give it to the postman, he will take it to the addressee and delivers; similarly, the fire acts as the postman: when you utter a mantra and offer some gross offering, he takes it to the 	addressee God and gives it there. Whatever you offer chanting the mantra ‘On Nama Shivaya’, it will reach Shiva. When you chant the mantra ‘Namo Narayanaya’, whatever you offers go to Narayana. These mantras are nothing but various addresses of Gods. Fire is nothing but the postman. When you utter the mantra and give the gross offering to the fire, fire transforms into the subtle essence and delivers it to the subtle form of God. 
Even if you write the address on the cover, and if there is no stamp it will not be delivered to the addressee.  Similarly when you utter the mantra if you don’t have love in your heart, it will not reach the subtle form of God. Therefore love and love is most essential. Whatever you offer with love, God will receive them with great joy. There should not be any scope for ostentation. When you offer everything with obedience, humility and love, He will definitely receive it. To think that it is getting wasted is big ignorance. All the offerings are reaching the subtle form of God.
There are five kinds of yajnas. ‘Brahmayajna’ -the offering made to the Brahma - the sacrifice for the sake of attaining Brahma. Secondly, the yajnas that you perform to please the various angels and demi-gods. There are yajnas performed in order to please your parents who have died or the fore-fathers who have died to offer them delicious food. The other is ‘bhootayajna’ and ‘maanushayajna’. Serving other human beings is ‘maanushayajna’. And actually ‘bhootayajna’ means you have to serve even the creatures – birds and beasts, insects and worms. We should perform all these yajnas. The highest of them is ‘Brahmayajna’. That yajna which we do in order to realise ourselves as Brahma and atma – that is ‘Brahmayajna’. 
Why are you performing these yajnas for the welfare of all people? There is no happiness in the world. When we talk that ‘Let all the people in all the worlds be happy’, what is the happiness we are talking about? It is not like a dog chewing the bone and deriving happiness. We are not performing this yajna for the sake of worldly happiness. We are doing it for the eternal bliss of God. When we pray that everybody be happy, this is not worldly happiness. We are doing it for spiritual happiness.
Where do you get spiritual happiness? Wherever it is, that is where you can find it. You have to find bliss within yourself. Union with God is called yoga. Merging in God is yoga. ‘Gam’ means to go, ‘yo’ means that God; going to Him is yoga. Happiness is union with God. When you find union with God, the kind happiness you find that is the permanent and eternal happiness. We are performing all these yaagas and yajnas for the sake of attaining that kind of spiritual, permanent happiness.
When you pray for the welfare of everybody, when you talk about ‘yogakshema’, it is ultimate, spiritual, permanent welfare and not the worldly welfare. You will find true happiness only when we get rid of the three obstacles of ‘mala’, ‘vikshepa’ and ‘aavarana’, get rid of body consciousness and selfishness; only then you will find permanent, eternal joy and happiness.
I conclude My Discourse aspiring that all of you will find that kind of eternal happiness and joy.",10/15/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
14,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 4 Discourse,"This sacred land of Bharat has given birth to many great men and women who have won international fame. This land of Bharat is the battleground from where the western heroes were thrown out by our Indian leaders. This land of Bharat is a land of great scholarship and also expertise in the fields of music, literature and fine arts. Having been born in this great country, O My devotees and children, it is your responsibility to uphold and safeguard the treasure and wealth of dharma of this country.
Embodiments of Love, Devotees, Students, Boys and Girls!
Our scriptures have revealed  for any human being it is very difficult to gain three things which lead us to attaining divine grace. The first is the human birth, second is desire for liberation and third is the great company of realised souls or men of wisdom.
 It’s a great opportunity for us to be born as human beings among 84 lacs of species of life on this earth. But it is not enough we are just born as human beings. But it is highly essential that we conduct ourselves as human beings. The great goal of human life is nothing but developing aspiration for liberation and nothing else. The right path of dharma is the path on which we will aspire to realise God.
There are four goals of human life –Dharma, right conduct; Artha, earning wealth and treasure; Kama, fulfilling our physical desires; and finally, liberation. But what actually means is you have to earn money through righteous means and then utilise it for moving forward on the spiritual path and attain liberation. That is the real human life.
‘Mumukshatwam’ means desire for liberation. It’s a big mistake if we think that we will gain liberation only after we drop this physical body. Even when you are living, if you can give up attachment to this world and worldly desires, that is liberation. If by any chance in our heart arises a desire for liberation, we should know that it is a great fortune conferred on us.
Even if you get the human birth and also develop desire for liberation, suppose you don’t get the guidance and company of a great soul, then your life will become useless. When we make good use of the opportunity to be with noble and great souls and learn the lessons taught by them, then our life will find fulfilment.
But we have the another great fortune conferred on us apart from having the human birth, apart from developing desire for liberation, apart from having gained the company of God Himself; the greatest fortune is that we are born in the sacred land of Bharat. This is a divine land, a sacred land, a glorious land, a land wherein we can attain the highest goal. Even the great divine incarnations are born in the womb of this great mother, Bharat, and not anywhere else. Bha-ra-tha means one with right feeling of devotion and also the right tune and right rhythm, you adore God and gain divine experience. Who is a Bharatheeya? Bharatheeya is one who derives great joy in bliss, in divinity, in God. 
It is not the quality of an Indian, a person born in the sacred land of Bharat, to only struggle to attain worldly wealth, treasure, pleasures and all the means by which we can get the sensual pleasures and also name and fame. It is very unfortunate we are born as Indians and we don’t behave as Indians. Bharatheeya is one who takes delight only in God. 
My dear children! You are very, very fortunate you are born in this great land of Bharat, you have developed desire for liberation and also you have won the Divine Presence of God Himself. Should never lose this great opportunity. Having obtained the Grace of Sai, don’t waste it; make good use of it. Once you lose it, you will never get it again. It is your primary duty to see that you make good use of the opportunity given to you.
So many number of children are getting admitted to our educational institutions. It is not just enough if a boy or a girl develops the desire to become a student; you need to have the right kind of educational institution also. Apart from the right kind of educational institutions, you should also have the right kind of teachers. These three things are human birth, desire for liberation and the company of the great souls. In this country of Bharat today, all the educational institutions which should become Saraswati mandirs- temples of Saraswati - are becoming temples of Lakshmi. When you ask any student, “What are you doing?” they say, “I am purchasing education.” They don’t say, “I am studying education.” The boy after having purchased education with money, once he gets educated, what is that he is going to do with his education?” He will only sell what he has purchased, nothing beyond that. When the boy or girl purchases education spending one lac of rupees, only desire they will have is to earn ten lacs of rupees; they will never think of the welfare of the world or service to society.
What is the use of earning that kind of useless education which leads you to only logic and argumentation and which will not confer upon you good wisdom? What is the use of learning education which ultimately leads you to death? The kind of education you should get is the education which will lead you to immortality.
Today Manjunath also was telling you that Narayan Bhat had a desire. What does Manjunath know how great the person of Narayan Bhat was? He had no desires at all. But he had only prayer. In a desire, there is the feeling of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, in prayer the feeling is of ‘you’ and ‘yours’. And he always said, “God’s Will will be done and not mine.” And if today the educational institutions in Swami’s name are multiplying, it is because of the prayers done by that Narayan Bhat.
Bhageeratha prayed so that the celestial Ganga – the Ganga in the heavens- will come down to earth to quench the thirst of the people on earth and he was given that grace by Lord Ishwara. Bhageeratha, very selflessly in order to quench the thirst of the fellow beings, he prayed to Lord Ishwara. Then Ishwara himself took upon that celestial Ganga on his matted hair. Because of the selfless prayer of Bhageeratha, even Ishwara took that celestial Ganga on his matted hair. 
Similarly because of the selfless prayers of Narayan Bhat, today God Himself has taken upon Himself fulfilment of his desire. Though there are crores and crores of people in the world, how many people are praying selflessly for others? It could be one or two people, not all people. Narayan Bhat with great prayer of world welfare, he offered all his wealth and properties at the Lotus Feet of God and they are finding fulfilment because of the Divine Grace today. He did not keep even a single rupee for himself. He thought even if he keeps a single rupee he will not get Divine Grace; therefore, he offered everything. And if I keep one rupee also with me it means I don’t have faith in God. He will give everything and He will look after me; He is looking after such a vast creation, will He not look after me?
 For crossing over the ocean of samsara, you cannot do it by penance, you cannot do it by going on pilgrimages, you cannot do it by studying of scriptures; only by service to noble souls you can attain liberation. Yajnas and yaagas are a part and parcel of our Indian culture; therefore, we are performing these yajnas. But yajna has another name – that means sacrifice. True yajna is full of sacrifice. Even if you don’t have the sacrificial fire, you may not have the yajna kunda – or the altar of fire- it is good enough you have a selfless thought in your mind. There is no greater sacrifice, the greater yajna, than offering one’s own body, mind and soul to the service of society. Sacrifice is not giving up your wife and children and going away to the forest; real sacrifice is sacrifice of selfishness within your own mind and that becomes yoga.
Today because of lack of time I will not tell you many things. But whatever I have told you, you have listened to it, you understand it and also contemplate on it and practise it. That is good enough for Me. For 85 years I went on giving discourses. But how many people are there who absorbed the teachings of Swami and demonstrated His teaching in their own lives? Therefore, I would like to tell you just listening is not enough, you contemplate on My teachings and also practise them in your lives. Otherwise, like holding a sieve to catch the water that comes from above, it will be useless.
I conclude My discourse aspiring and blessing you that all of you would cleanse the vessels of your heart and fill it with pure and sacred feelings and lead a very noble life.

15,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 5 Discourse,"Embodiments of Divine Love!
Every person has six relatives. Truth is the mother; wisdom is the father; righteousness is the brother; compassion is the friend; peace is the wife; forgiveness is the son – these are the six relatives of every person.
Everyone who is born in this world will be born in a family. In the family there will be many relatives like father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters. But all these relationships last only as long as this body is there.  As soon as the body is lost, we also lose all relationships. Who is whose wife, who is the father, who is the mother, who is the son?
Before you get married, the girl whom you are going to get married, you don’t know anything about her. You only know that she is daughter of somebody; you will not think that she is your wife. But as soon as you get married you enjoy all her happiness, you also share her burden of sorrow. Before the marriage, even if that girl gets fever, you don’t bother about it because you think somebody has got fever. Once you get married even before she asks you, you go here and there, meet a doctor, consult him and get them medicines for your wife. Before marriage, who is she, who are you? You are just separate human beings, entities. Because of the marriage, there comes the bondage. 
Once you give up the body, there is neither wife, nor husband. Again and again you are born, again and again you die, again and again you live in the womb of your mother. Therefore, all the kind of relationships that you develop on this earth are only bondages; they are not real relationships.  But there is only one true relationship. That is the ‘atma sambandha’, or the relationship with the atma.
There is only one atma who is the indweller in all the beings. Only one God dwells in the hearts of every one. Only when you live for God you can know that everyone is your brother, everyone is your sister. When you come to the stage, you address everybody as brothers and sisters; you only just say that, are you experiencing it or behaving that way in your life? And you talk so many things; do you put it into practise? All these things are kind of mean mindedness. For the broadminded people the whole world is their family. True devotion is to think that everyone in the world is belonging to you. Whomever we salute, we are saluting God Himself. We should know that whomever you ridicule, you are ridiculing God Himself. Our true relationship should be with God who is the resident of the heart of everyone; all other relationships are a kind of bondage.
Once upon a time there lived a couple who loved each other so intensely. Husband had a feeling for the sake of my wife, I am ready to give up my life. Wife also was absolutely loyal to the husband; she was ready to do anything for the husband. With so much love and affection between them, they led their family life. One day a very noble soul – a mahatma- came to that village. All the people of the village joined the satsang and these two also went there. In that satsang, the noble soul taught that life in this world is temporary, wealth and youth are temporary, wife and children are temporary; only truth and good name are permanent. This world is called ‘jagat’ because everything comes and goes. Therefore all the relationships that we develop among ourselves are temporary and not permanent. 
But this husband did not like the words of the noble soul. He said, “My wife is ready to do anything for my sake. That the relationship between me and my wife - to call it mere bondage is wrong. We have a very deep relationship of love and fellowship and not just attachment.” Because he was arguing that way, the saint called him aside and spoke to him separately. If you want to know the truth, you just do what I tell you to do. “You pretend to be dead. I will teach you a mantra by chanting which you will really look like a dead person even without breathing. But whatever is happening around, you will be able to listen to everything. It is a state of a ‘dhyana’ or meditation. Then you will be able to understand the truth.” And he gave him the mantra and sent the husband home.
Those days the houses were very small. Houses were small and doors were more small. Door was so small only one person could pass through it; always it was a kind of a one-way traffic. You can’t walk straight into the house; you have to bend your head and then go into the house. And this man was living in such a small house. So he staged the drama of being dead. And he was lying down on the cot; everybody thought that he was dead. So all the people got ready to perform the cremation rites of the person. Wife also was shedding tears of sorrow and she was miserable. Finally it was decided that body should be taken outside the home. Because he was in a state of meditation, the body has become very stiff. And the legs and hands could not be moved also. Therefore they decided they will take the person along with the cot on which he was lying. But the door was so small. However much they tried, this cot could not be taken out of the door. Everybody thought anyhow this person is dead, we have to take him to the crematorium; therefore, better we break this door so that the cot can be taken out. Young men started breaking down the door. Wife came running. “What are you doing?” And they said, “This body cannot be taken out through the small door. Therefore we are breaking the door so that we can take the body out.” “Why do you want to break the door? Anyhow he is dead; you cut off his limbs and take him out. Anyhow he is dead; at least door we can save.” And immediately his meditation was broken. He got up and sat up. “Is this all you love me?” he asked his wife. “I thought you love me so much, my dear wife, but today I know how much you love me.” Then he thought this bondage of family is no good for him.
I am not telling you that everybody will be like that. All worldly relationships are selfish in nature. It is only the selfish relationship of give and take. Nobody would like to live selflessly. Only God is selfless. All the time He puts in effort to make you good and looks to keep you happy. But you are all the time worrying without thinking of God and making your life a funeral pyre. You are struggling so much to attain things which are temporary; you don’t do anything to attain something which are permanent.
Being born is a worry; living on earth is a worry; family life is a worry; friendship is a kind of worry; living on this earth is a worry; death is a worry; even happiness is a worry; money is a worry; all actions lead to worry; difficulties are a worry. Therefore, My dear people, at least now onwards think of one worry which will remove all your worries. If you worry to attain God’s Grace, that is good enough. When you contemplate on God, you will get rid of all the worries. 
Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? What is the destiny of our life? Only once we have to enquire into this truth we will find out the Truth and we will be very happy. There is no happiness equal to wisdom. When you get true wisdom that I am God Himself, I am the atma, you will get rid of all worries. ‘Yogakshema’ or welfare does not mean that you have to struggle for your family and earning money. ‘Yogakshema’ means we have to put in effort to attain the highest happiness or joy or bliss. Happiness is union with God. Only when you attain union with God, you will get permanent happiness. Till then you will be getting only temporary pleasure and you will remain temporary. Therefore we have to give up everything that is temporary and put in effort to attain God who is permanent. 
And our boy today spoke to you and expounded the story of Bali Chakravarthi in Bhagavatham. He was born in the demons’ family. But he had only the feelings of a great devotee. We are born in the human family but we don’t develop that kind of devotion. And our life is not reflected in our lineage but in our actions.
Not by money, not by progeny, not in activity you find immortality; only by sacrifice you attain immortality. If you are the child of immortality, you should know where you get immortality. Not by action, not by progeny, not by money; only by sacrifice you attain immortality. What is that we need to sacrifice? We have to sacrifice our selfishness and self-interest, ego and attachments. We came here empty handed. When we die we go empty handed. And it’s a waste of your effort if you want to attain all things in this world which are very temporary.
My dears, therefore, all of you should try to cultivate good relationship with God which is permanent. All others are temporary. The emperor Bali - he sacrificed the empire itself but till today we remember him and we listen about his greatness, nobility and great name.  Only two things are permanent – truth and good name. We have to put in effort and struggle to attain good, noble name.
Many students develop the desire to become engineers and doctors. It’s good. There is nothing wrong in those desires. And it depends upon what you do after becoming an engineer or doctor. If you become an engineer, just not struggling to fill your stomach, you should also struggle to serve the society. After becoming a doctor, you should not just think of becoming a great doctor, earn lot of money and good name and fame; but most important is you should become good person.
All the devotees who are seated here and enjoying great delight in listening to the stories of God and many talks. But in the background many people are struggling hard to provide you this opportunity. What kind of people are there? Among the volunteers, there are from Bangalore many engineers, doctors, businessmen and lawyers. You may think when they are doing ordinary service becoming volunteers here; you may think that they are ordinary people. All those who are running around here and there wearing a scarf are all people with big degrees. They are serving you with great humility and a sense of obedience. All of us are servants and nobody is a leader. Even God is born to serve anyone. God becomes their divine incarnation, an avatar, with the only objective of loving and serving everybody. When God Himself is involving in service activity, you should also involve in service and find fulfilment in your life. 
In order to organise a programme like this, we do need the services of lots of people. We need all kinds of people – we need cooks, we need decorators, we need sound system people, lights people, we need drivers. In order to perform this wonderful yajna, only purohits are not enough. And more greater than the yajna being performed by the purohits , greater is the yajna of service being done by the volunteers. All these people are doing everything for the love of Swami. There is no selfishness, there is no ego, and there is no attachment in their activity. You are all coming here and going away from here– you many not know this. That is why I am telling you what is happening in the background. I am not really praising the people who are doing it. They are not doing it for good name. They have only one desire – to satisfy Swami in all ways. And there are many officers in very high positions, they want to do service, they don’t get leave but they are doing both service and their office work. Whole night they are working from home and doing service here. They don’t eat food or sleep. We are able to run this wonderful programme because of their good service. We have to offer our gratitude to those people.
All of you should become servants. True servants are true leaders. One who puts into practice is a real teacher. Therefore a true servant is a true leader. When all of us become servants, our ego and arrogance will be completely eliminated.
Sometimes when you are involve yourselves in service activities there may be some differences of opinion. They are not spiritual differences; there are differences in the activity. Five fingers are different in their shape and size. When all of them get together, the work happens. Only when you work with unity, you can achieve anything.
I am conducting all this program with the only purpose of making you pure and also eliminate your ego. You have to do service not only here; even when you go back home. And here, when somebody comes and asks you for water, you run and give them a tumbler of water. However big officer you may be, you are doing the service of giving water. But when you go back home, ordering your wife, “Get me coffee! Get me water!” is not correct. What service you do here, should do service there also. In fact the service should begin at home. When you do service at home, set an ideal for your children, they will also join the service activity. Children will not learn from what you speak; they will learn from what you do. It is not just speaking; you have to practise what you speak and develop a good image for yourself; then everybody will look up to you.
They are putting off the lights. Probably I think I have to close My discourse. There are some people - you gave them a mike; they will never leave it. Keep on talking. 
And once it happened somebody was giving a speech like that. Everybody got up and went away one by one. There was only one person who stayed back. The speaker was very happy at least there was one person who understood his philosophy that he was talking about. “After everybody has left, you are staying back. What did you understand out of my talk?” “I am not here to listen to your philosophy; all these lights and tents belong to me. I am just waiting for you to stop speaking so that I can wind up all the mike system and take it away.”
We don’t want to become such speakers. But all those spoke here they spoke very well. Their words emanated from their hearts not from only their lips. That is the language of the heart. Only one language.
The students have come all the way from Alike to stage a yakshagana performance ‘Dakshayajna’ which you have heard yesterday and today. All of you witness that and derive delight.",10/17/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
16,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 6 Discourse,"That son of Nanda has come back as ‘Anandabala’, the child of bliss, in order to play with His playmates; it is the same Ramachandra who has come back as ‘Aaramachandra’ without any care, without any worry in order to recognise His servants; it is the same Sayeesha of Parti who has come here as Muddenahallieesha, the God of Muddenahalli in order to recognise His devotees; it is the same Maha Vishnu who has come back as Mahi Vishnu – the Vishnu on this earth- in order to do His work with His instruments.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Where is God? Since times immemorial people have been searching for God, going to many pilgrimage centres, and studying many scriptures and looking for Him everywhere. Wherever he searches for Him, He is not seen with his eye. Is He in Vaikuntha? He is not there in Vaikuntha. If you think that He is in Kailasa, truly He is not there in Kailasa. 
Where is He really? This is the reply given by God Himself. “I won’t dwell in Vaikuntha; I will not reside in the hearts of the yogis; wherever my devotees sing, I install Myself.” Without God, devotee cannot exist; and without devotee, God cannot exist. When the child is born, a mother is also born. Before the child is born, she is only a woman, not a mother. Only when the child is born, woman is transformed into a mother. You may look for God anywhere; you won’t find Him. He will be where the devotee is living. Wherever there is pure devotion, God also resides there.
This evening in the Bhagavatha exposition we have learnt a little about the story of Krishna. ‘Krishna’ means ‘karsh yati iti krishna’. That which attracts; that is the Krishna principle. God is full of magnetic power. Though magnet has complete magnetic power, it will attract the iron piece only when the iron piece approaches the magnet. The iron filing will be attracted only it does not have any kind of impurity like ego or attachment or wicked qualities. If the iron piece is full of rust and dust, however much it may try, it will not be attracted by the magnet. The same God looking upon whom Prahlada adored Him, worshipped Him; looking at the same God, Hiranyakashipu hated Him. The same Lord Krishna whom gopas and gopikas loved and adored, looking at the same Krishna, Kamsa hated him. Krishna is one and the same; Vishnu is one and the same. Everything depends on the feelings of the devotees. Only that piece of iron which is free from rust and dust will be attracted by the magnetic power of the magnet. A piece of iron which is full of rust and dust, it may get very close to the magnet but there won’t be any change in it. Seeing that this iron piece with rust and dust is not attracted, it is foolish on our part to think that the magnet has no power. Not at all. Magnet has definitely power but because of the evil which is there in the iron piece it will not get attracted. Similarly in a human being who is full of rust and dust of ego and attachment, even when that person comes to the Divine Presence, there won’t be any transformation in him. Otherwise the same Rama who was followed and adored and worshipped by even monkeys, why should Ravana looking at him, hate him? This kind of perversion happened because of the evil which was there in Ravana. Even monkeys because of their pure feelings they could see God in the personality of Rama.
God is always ever pure, sacred, blissful and always steady. Actually it is only your own reflection you see in the mirror and you don’t find anything else there. When you talk to God with love, God also will talk to you with love. When you hate God, our own hatred gets reflected towards us. Therefore, only when we give up our evil qualities, we will be able to recognise God. Because of the rust and dust of ego and attachment, even this magnetic power of God will not attract you.
But in cowherds - gopalas – in brindavan and the gopikas, there was no rust and dust. They wanted only Krishna and nothing else. Krishna left Brindavan and went to Mathura. Everybody was grieving over it. Even after reaching Mathura, Krishna was always thinking of gopalas – the cowherd boys and girls. And the cowherd boys and girls in Brindavan they were so sorrowful and they were so miserable. Because of His own regulation, Krishna did never return to Brindavan. And gopikas and gopas could not go to Mathura. And Krishna will not come to Brindavan. But all the time they were looking for Krishna in Brindavan both the cowherd boys and girls and they were miserable.
And there was a very dear friend of Krishna by name Uddhava. Through Uddhava, Krishna sent a message to the cowherd boys and girls in order to demonstrate to Uddhava the deep devotion of those people. Uddhava went to Brindavan with the purpose of removing the grief of gopas and gopikas. But these cowherd boys and girls were always thinking of Krishna and their minds were immersed in the Krishna principle and were enjoying the deep divine bliss.
Uddhava came to Radha. Even Uddhava was having the colour of Krishna – the dark complexion. Looking at Uddhava, everybody thought it was Krishna Himself who had come and they came running. There came Radha also. Uddhava got down from the chariot, approached Radha with the desire to hand over the message of Krishna to her. Uddhava was teaching her Krishna is everywhere; He is all pervasive.  Radha asked him, “Which Krishna you are talking about?” And Uddhava answered, “Krishna, who left Brindavan and reached Mathura; he has sent the message to you. This is what I am telling you.” Radha laughed aloud, “Keep your philosophy with yourself.  My Krishna is always in me. Just I close my eyes and I can see Him all the time. What went to Mathura was only an illusion, not Krishna. My Krishna is always within me. I am the shadow of Krishna. Where there is shadow, there should be the object also. Where there is reflection, the object also should be there. If you see Radha still living, it is because Krishna is with her. It is not necessary to listen to your philosophy. Every moment I experience it and enjoy it.”
And you look at Mathura what is happening there – there is great jealousy between the two wives of Krishna, Rukmini and Satyabhama. Rukmini and Satyabhama wanted Krishna to stay with them only. Why? They thought that Krishna was a body and they desired his physical form. Radha knows that He is consciousness, He is the principle of energy; and knowing that she is always happy. Radha therefore did not experience any sorrow.
Wherever you go, you find Radha Krishna temples and very rarely you find Rukmini Krishna or Satyabhama Krishna temples. Many people without knowing the spiritual relationship between Radha and Krishna, at their level they think of a kind of a relationship. Their thinking is their own reaction, reflection and resound; that’s not the truth. A thief thinks everybody is a thief. A devotee thinks everybody is a devotee. Therefore Radha was never sad. She never ever thought that Krishna was the body. Krishna is the form of the body. He is the God, He is Consciousness, He is energy.
Even when Sai Baba gave up His body many devotees were crying, shedding tears, looking for Him here and there. Body is same and equal for everybody. The body made up of five elements is temporary. However much you may spend, whatever medicines you may consume, you can never protect the body from death. Don’t be proud of your youth or money or manpower; it will be removed in a minute.
 In every school there will be some rules and regulations. In a school according to the time-table at a particular time there will be prayer, class and also lunch break. For this world there are the rules and regulations of place, time and causation. Even the Principal who built the school has to go according to the rules and regulations. More important than others, he has to practise that. Similarly God when he comes down as a divine incarnation in the human form, it is inescapable that He has to follow the rules of place, time and circumstances. Any body which is born has to die. But the indweller in the body is permanently there. When you realise that indweller divinity, then you can get rid of all attachment and sorrow. That is why it is said, “Wisdom is seeing the unity of all existence. There is no disease worse than greed. There is no enemy worse than your own anger. There is no sorrow higher than poverty. There is no happiness higher than wisdom.” Wisdom is not just knowledge. Knowledge is what you study in a lesson – the theory part. Wisdom is really not knowledge but experience. Only when you experience, you know the unity of all existence.
Yesterday a yakshagana was staged here. Alike students put on various costumes and they were playing their roles on the stage. And there was the role of Sati also. Sati was also a boy; not a girl. Suppose just because he puts on the costume of Sati if he thinks he is a girl, is it not a big mistake? Only when he removes his costume and the dress he is wearing, he knows that he is a boy. Similarly Shiva and Daksha Prajapati they were having different kinds of costumes on them; therefore, they were looking different. When you put on the costume, you have to act according to the role given to you. When they remove their costumes, even Shiva will realise, “Shiva was only a role that I played in the drama.” 
And all of us have various costumes on us and are moving around. There are some who are wearing the costume of purohits, some are teachers, some are musicians, some are men, some are ladies. Because we are putting on the bodies which are like various costumes, we think we are different. But costume is not the truth. After the drama, we have to give up the costume. Only when we give up the costume, we recognise the Truth and enjoy delight. And all this show of life is nothing but a drama. It is like fancy dress. And suppose the various people in the world behave differently as Malaysians or Americans or English people, it is because of the various costumes they are wearing. But the atma principle in everybody is one and the same. When you look at the atma principle in everybody, everybody is equal. According to the role being given in a drama, sometimes you have to cry; sometimes you have to laugh. Depending on their roles, they will have various feelings. But one day or the other, drama will have to stop. After the drama, we remove the costume and know our Truth.
Sometimes director also comes down to the stage.  Many times director comes and tells the actors how very sincerely according to the principles of sathya and dharma, you have to enact your role. In fact the director has no role or no duty; in order to demonstrate to them real ideal, he comes down. Sometimes director himself puts on a costume and comes as an actor in the drama. Similarly in various yugas or ages, God comes down in various human roles to play His role.
What is the meaning of God incarnating? With love and affection for mankind, God comes down to their level along with individual consciousness and also divine consciousness. An Avatar or divine incarnation has both individual and divine consciousness. God when He plays the role of an avatar He gets immersed in His role and he plays His role perfectly. Then you keep telling it is a kind of yogamaya or yoganatakam. But the Truth is that the Avatar also has divine consciousness. Divine consciousness is always there; because of the individual consciousness, he looks like an ordinary human being. Only then you can mix with Him and enjoy His company and learn lessons, But at no time, Avatar loses His divine consciousness. Depending on His individual consciousness, for you to think that He is also an ordinary human being, He also has birth and death is a mistake. It is not truth; He is only playing a role in the drama. In order to teach the principles of truth, righteousness love, peace and non-violence, He plays a role. In this way God came down as Rama, Krishna, Buddha or Jesus in order to play His role to teach the mankind. 
The conscious power is the Truth and nothing else is the Truth. It is said in the scriptures God is eternal and the world is transient. Knowing that this world is nothing but an illusion, you enter into divine consciousness. As long as there is illusion, as long as you identify yourself with the role that you are playing, ego and attachment are inescapable. Identifying yourself with the role in the drama thinking that this is your personality, this is your name, this is my wealth is not correct.
Who are you before you got on to the drama stage? Who are you after the drama? That truth we have to find out. When you recognise that Truth, there is no scope for any sorrow, misery or attachment. When you experience oneness of all existence, where is attachment, where is sorrow? There is only Truth; scholars speak in different ways.
I have been organising all these programmes so that you get into Divine Presence and Divine Company and recognise the Truth getting rid of ego and attachment. As is the feeling, so does it happen. This world is based on your own mind. What is mind? It is a bundle of thoughts. And mind is nothing but a conglomeration of various thoughts. Mind is like a key also. When you turn it right, it will open. When you turn it to left, the lock will get locked. When you turn your mind towards God, you will enjoy God consciousness. When you focus on your mind on this worldly life, it’s a bondage. That is why it is said mind is responsible for your bondage and liberation both.
After having come here, gathered here in this good company in the Divine Presence; after having learnt and heard so many good talks; you should learn these lessons. For that your effort is very important. There are many people like Kamsa who talk philosophy. Kamsa is telling Vasudeva and Devaki that we don’t have really any birth and death and trying to assuage them. After having killed so many children, he is talking about philosophy. But all the time he is afraid of his own death.
Once it happened there was a big landlord. He had a lot of cows owned by him. There was an old servant who looked after the cattle. The servant also had one bull of his own.  When he took all these cattle, the bulls of the rich man and also his own bull for grazing, there was a fight between the two bulls – one his own and the other the landlord’s. The bull of the cowherd killed the bull of the rich landlord. He was very much frightened. With great fear he approached the landlord. “Master, there was a very bad incident today.” “What is it?” “There was a battle between your bull and my bull.” The landlord said, “Oh, it is so ordinary! What is great about that incident? Even human beings many times fight like that. It is natural for the animals to fight. It is ordinary.” First he said, “Your bull killed my bull.” Because of the confusion and fear, he said it in a reverse way. The landlord heard it. “What is great about it? Anything that is born has to die. That is why your bull has died. It is absolutely normal. Such things happen. Don’t worry about that.” The poor servant said after recognising he had reported wrongly, “Actually what has happened is my bull has killed your bull.”But the landlord got angry and told him, “How can your bull kill my bull? You have to pay all the money; only then you can go home from here.” Landlord communicated and spoke great philosophy when he first heard that the servant’s bull was killed by his bull.
Similarly many devotees come here. Many devotees say, “If really transformation has to happen in me, it should be by God Himself.” But in order to earn money and develop their families, they will put in lot of effort. But when it comes to transformation, he will talk philosophy saying, “Only by God’s Grace there can be any good transformation.”
God’s Grace is always there. God’s Grace is equal on everybody. In the same way as sun shines equally on everybody, God’s Grace is there on everybody equally. When you wash your clothes, if you only dry it up in sunshine, the clothes will be dried. That effort you have to make. And purohits they do offer many offerings to the fire and they do this yajna. What is that you did sitting here? But when you come here and sit here, you have to offer the six enemies within you – at least one of them – into the fire and leave the place. At least to some extent if you get rid of your ego and attachment, then we can say that yajna is successful. Just coming here, listening to talks, taking prasadam and going away is not correct. At least one evil quality in you, you have to offer into the fire in the yajna kunda and leave the place. And one by one, if you get rid of your evil qualities, one day or the other, you will become perfect. 
Selfishness is the cause. And the root cause of selfishness is ego. When you give up ego, you get rid of all evil qualities. Therefore, we have to reduce our ego and attachments and develop divine consciousness. Many incarnations may come but it will not be useful for you. Therefore after having come to this sacred land and witnessed these very sacred programmes here, you have to get rid of your ego and attachments, realise God within yourselves and derive bliss.
Because today Bhagavatha has expounded the story of Krishna, sing the bhajan of Krishna.  
Wherever there is the name, there is the form also. There is an inseparable relationship between name and form. When you utter the name of Krishna, Krishna is already there. When you utter the name of Sai, Sai is always there. Without name, there is no form; without form, there is no name. When you think of the form, automatically get the name. When you utter the name, immediately the form will manifest there. Therefore there is no way you can say God is here, He is not there. In whichever place, devotees with pure love think of Him, God manifests there. But if you want to develop pure love, you have to give up the impurities of ego and attachment. There will be some impurities in the water that you get from the land. You can’t drink water as it is. You get rid of the impurities in the water and drink only pure water. Only when you get rid of all the evil qualities in you, develop pure love for God, then you can really see God also.",10/18/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
17,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 7 Discourse,"Lord is the embodiment of peace and goodness; all names are His, all forms are His; and He is the very personification of Sat, Chit, and Ananda – Being, Awareness, and Bliss, and Sathyam Shivam Sundaram – Truth, Beauty and Goodness.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
On this very sacred day after having listened to the exposition of the leelas of Lord Krishna, and having enjoyed in the music of the very well known couple, and after partaking of the delight of listening to the devotional songs, my heart is filled with total bliss. After listening to that sweet story of the Lord, and listening to that sweet and melodious music, and bhajans in praise of God, we have to forget our body consciousness and enjoy divine consciousness.
It is not true on our part to think that bliss is something which we can attain sometime later in our life. At all times wherever you are, you can experience this bliss. But this bliss is not connected with the physical body. That moment when our mind gets away from the body and focuses on God, immediately, very moment, we experience bliss. All the time I have been addressing you as embodiments of love, embodiments of divine atma, embodiments of divinity itself. All of you are very embodiments of divinity enjoying the wonderful bliss which is the ultimate Truth and which is aware of that bliss and also you are the embodiments of truth, goodness and beauty. When we focus our mind not on the body but on the divine principle, immediately we can attain divine bliss. This divine bliss is eternal and permanent and it is not a transient one. The transient pleasures come today and disappear tomorrow.
 Food that we partake today satisfies us only today and tomorrow again we feel hungry and would like to eat food. The joy that we derive through eating food is not permanent. When you eat food in order to satisfy your hunger, definitely you will get some very temporary joy and happiness. But after sometime after the food is digested, again there will be hunger in your stomach and you feel that you should look for food. You may have any number of worldly desires; when you fulfil one desire, for a temporary period you will enjoy some happiness but after that it will disappear. But the divine bliss of experience of God is there at all times at all places and is eternal. We have to put in effort and struggle to attain that bliss.
Even the cowherd boys and girls of Brindavan after having understood the divine principle of Sri Krishna, they enjoyed loving Krishna. Once they heard the uttering of the name ‘Krishna’, immediately they would forget everything, they would lose their body consciousness and enjoy divine bliss. All the time they prayed to Krishna, “Lord, in our deserts of our hearts please bring the downpour of your love and also play on your flute so that we can be immersed in divine bliss. In the loveless deserts of our hearts, you plant the seeds of love. Seeds of love in the hearts they result in a downpour of love, they flow as rivers of love and take us to the ocean of bliss. O Lord, please play on your flute.” They prayed to Krishna, “Our hearts have dried up because of the worldly desires. Remove those worldly desires and sow the seeds of love and play on your flute and may rivers of bliss flow in our personalities.”
Today our person said Krishna means ‘Krishatheethi Krishna’. One who cultivates our hearts is Krishna. What is this cultivation? With the flow of discrimination please till our hearts, remove the weeds of worldly desires, plant the seeds of love and lead us to yourself in divine bliss.
After having come to God, aspiring for very little things of life is not correct.
Once upon a time there was a temple of Krishna in Brindavan. That is referred to as Shrinatha mandiram. The great emperor Krishnadevaraya went to Brindavan to this temple –Shrinatha mandiram - in order to have the darshan of the Lord. In fact that region where Brindavan was there at that point of time was being ruled by a sultan. The sultan felt, “This great emperor from south India has come to my place. Without meeting me, he is going there to meet somebody else in Brindavan. Since there is somebody greater than me, he is going to meet that person in Brindavan and not me.” He was curious to know who that person was and he was asking everyone. The sultan also sent his messenger to see where Krishnadevaraya was going in Brindavan. In disguise, his messengers went there and found out where he was going and came back. They reported to the sultan, “There is a big temple there.” Sultan asked them, “Who is residing in that mandir?” “We asked them. They said ‘There are two people there. One is Gopal Maharaj – the great king Krishna- and His queen, Radha Rani.’” Sultan thought, “I never ever knew that there were such great king and queen in Brindavan; now I should go and see them. Krishnadevaraya comes all the way from south India and goes first to that temple; definitely those king and queen should be very great.” With great sincerity and devotion, sultan also went to the temple. He was a Mohammedan. But he was very innocent. 
He went to Brindavan with the only desire that I should see this great king and great queen there. When he went there, the temple doors were closed. Priests have returned to their homes. But he felt very sad. “Because I came late, I could not get his darshan. Unless I have his darshan, I will not return .I will wait here for him to come and grant me darshan.” And it was night. He had come all alone without anybody accompanying him. He sat there. He was sitting there and praying, “Who is this great king and great queen? I need to see them.” He did not sleep the whole night. All the time he was chanting the name of Gopal Maharaj and Radha Rani; who are these people.
Dawn occurred. And he heard some sound and looked up to see Krishna and Radha came out of the temple. Looking at them he derived great delight. He forgot himself, lost his body consciousness and immersed himself in the divine bliss. Then Krishna asked Sultan whether you can do a little thing for me. “I am going to Yamuna to bathe. And till I return please keep all my jewels with you.” The sultan obeyed his command and he sat there with the jewels. Both Krishna Maharaj and Radha Rani blessed him abundantly and they went out. He was sitting there. 
After some time the priests came there. The priests saw this gentleman sitting outside the temple with his hands full of jewels. They did not know he was the sultan; they thought it was thief. They immediately made out that the jewels belonged to Krishna and Radha; they started censuring and criticising him. But this gentleman was full of bliss; he did not reply at all. After having seen Krishna, he had lost his body consciousness and was immersed in divine consciousness. And they ridiculed him, blamed him, even beat him up but he did not mind it.
One of the priests noticed that the temple doors were closed and lock also was there - it was not opened at all. How did he get the jewels? Then they came to know. The priests easily realised that because of his great devotion, Krishna and Radha came out of the temple, blessed him. Not only did they bless him, in order to demonstrate to the world that he had their darshan, they also left their jewels with him.
Sultan does not know who is Krishna Maharaj or who is Radha Rani. He never heard Bhagavatham. He never heard the leelas of Krishna. He never sang the bhajans. But with great love he waited for Krishna’s darshan; that’s why he got the darshan.
We also should never stop before we have God’s darshan. But how can we have his darshan? Whatever you may do, you may study lot of scriptures, go around all the pilgrimage centres in the world, do great penance whatever you may do, you will not have the darshan. If you just develop love, God is there in love itself. 
You have caught hold of something; till you get it, don’t leave your hold. You have desired something; don’t give up your desire till that desire finds fulfilment. You have asked for something; don’t give up asking till it is given to you. You have thought of something; don’t give up that thought till that thought finds fulfilment. Without being able to resist your pull of love, the God should manifest for you or you have to fall down, collapse without body consciousness. That is the right thing. Going back is the middle is not the hallmark of a devotee. When we say that we want God it is not just saying through lips, till you get God you should not give up your hold. Whatever difficulties and obstacles you encounter, with great courage and determination you should get over them and find God. 
A sincere person will definitely get wisdom. ‘Shraddha’ is a combination of love and faith. One side is love, other side is faith. Shraddha is having both faith and love. Among the six types of spiritual treasures, the most important and the first one is shraddha. Shraddha arises from the heart, not from the mind. Only when we aspire for God wholeheartedly, only then you will find God. Therefore the easiest and the subtlest path to attain God is the path of devotion. If you have true devotion there won’t be any other emotions. All the negative qualities like sorrow, misery or even anguish, everything you will forget when you have devotion.
In spite of all hardships and obstacles, Meera was all the time singing of Krishna. She was immersed. Her husband, Rana, wanted her to give up devotion to Krishna and he wanted Meera to develop devotion to him; but she never gave up. Like our Badri, she also all the time carrying the memories of Krishna. And she sang, “My own is only Krishna, Gopala and nobody else. And my husband is really Krishna who has the crown of peacock feathers. Rana is not my husband; and my Lord is Krishna Himself.”
She gave up her palace and went to Brindavan singing of Krishna. What was she singing? “O mind, let us go to the shores of Ganga and Yamuna. Ganga and Yamuna -the rivers- have pure water. And the body becomes very cool. Let us go to the shores of Ganga and Yamuna.” What are these Ganga and Yamuna? The tears of bliss from the two eyes are Ganga and Yamuna. When you sing with devotion, the tears of bliss flow down your cheeks - that is Ganga and Yamuna. And the place of Krishna is the centre of the two eye brows.
She went on singing and finally reached Brindavan. But she looked for Krishna but she did not find Krishna. She was so very miserable that she was not able to see Krishna but went on singing of Krishna and went to Brindavan. But she had great determination. “I will not give up till I get the darshan of Krishna.” And she went there, she was so tired.  She collapsed hitting her head on the door of the temple. Immediately she had the darshan of Krishna. So then she realised, “Krishna is not somewhere else to look for; He is within me. He is my divine consciousness, He is my atma, He is within me. And wherever I looked for Krishna, finally I saw Him within myself.” She adored Krishna with so much of love and devotion; that’s why she could get Krishna. She did not have any attachments. And she had no attachment to her family life. She had only one attachment. That is attachment to Krishna.
Yesterday the expounder of Bhagavatham said, “The navagrahas -nine planets - will not harm us if we have the Krishna planet.” ‘Krishna graha’ means ‘anugraha’, the divine grace. If you enjoy divine grace, no grahas or planets can hinder you. Therefore you have to always pray for the divine grace. 
Whatever we do, is very much less to attain God. Till we realise God, our whole life is a waste. Whatever we think, whatever we say, whatever we do in our life; if we don’t find God ,all that is a waste. Therefore you have to put in effort to realise God within yourself. And He is thirsty after love. Wherever there is love, He comes running there. 
And when Krishna stole butter and ate it and ran away, Yashoda went behind him searching for him.  She could not find him anywhere. But on the floor she saw thee footprints of Krishna. And she could easily make out one was the left footprint and another was the right footprint. Once she followed the right and left footprints, she could get to Krishna.
When I left this world, I left my footprints – left and right- on this earth. What is this left and right? The left foot print is love and the right one is service.  If you follow my footprints of love and service, definitely you will reach Me. Therefore, Love everyone, and serve everyone. And then you will merge in Me. God is not anywhere else, He is within you. In order to reach Him, we have to follow his teachings and follow His footprints of love and service, then we can reach Him. That is love and service, love and service and nothing else.
Among all the 18 puranas, there are two words of the Vyasa which are	the essence. ‘Punya ‘or merit is to help others, ‘papa’ or sin is to hurt others. Therefore, Help ever, Hurt never. Love All, Serve All. You need not have to utter both ‘Love All’ and ‘Serve All’. You just say ‘Love All’. Can we walk on one foot? Not at all. Along with the right foot, left foot should also join. Wherever there is love, service will follow. When we practise love and service in our lives, we will reach Krishna. Therefore, following this path of love and path of service, you realise God within yourself and enjoy the bliss.
The embodiment of Satchidananda, God, is not anywhere else. And, in fact, it is your real nature – that is Satchidananda. I am not the subsconscious mind, I am not the intelligence, I am not the ego, I am not any of the five senses; I am myself Chidananda – the bliss of consciousness. When you always chant the mantra, ‘I am not the body, I am the atma’, immediately you will be able to realise your true nature. 
Develop love and share love.",10/19/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
18,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 8 Discourse,"I am not a man, I am not an angel, I am not a demi-god; I am not a Brahmana or a Kshatriya or a Vaishya or a Shudra; I am not a brahmachari – a celibate, or a gruhastha – householder, or vanastha – a hermit; I am truly the teacher of eternal Truth, embodiment of Truth, Goodness and Beauty.
He is the embodiment of eternal bliss, the very personification of perfect wisdom, and He is the ultimate happiness. He is beyond the dualities and He is the eternal witness to everything. He is the One and the only one, and ever pure, and he is the destination for all philosophical investigations. 
God is formless. It’s a kind of ignorance to say God has such and such a name, and such and such a form. He is always in the state of formlessness without any particular form. He incarnates on the earth with four objectives: first is ‘shistarakshana’, safeguarding the good people; ‘dushtasikshana’, educating the evil people; ‘dharmasthaapana’, establishment of dharma; and ‘satyabodhana’, teaching of eternal Truth.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Out of all these four objectives, the most important is the teaching of the eternal Truth. If we get rid of the duality by knowing the Truth, we will be able to experience great divine bliss. Many times He has incarnated on this earth but first and foremost His objective is to teach the Truth.
He is the very embodiment of wisdom. What is wisdom or ‘jnana’? What is Truth? Seeing unity of all existence - that is wisdom. He is beyond the dualities, and the three gunas or the three attributes. The whole world is full of duality. The first is positive, second is negative. Wherever there is day, there is also the night. Wherever there is birth, death is inescapable. Wherever there is victory, there is also defeat. Wherever there is a good name, many times it could happen that there is ill-reputation. In order to teach us how we can remain equanimous in this world of dualities, that is why God incarnates. It is said yoga is equanimity. As long as we lead a life in the darkness of ignorance, it is not possible for us to attain equanimity or ‘samatwa’. In order to teach us this truth, God incarnates on earth. 
When Rama incarnated, He taught the Truth in three ways. He had three pledges: one wife, one word, one arrow. And during those times, these were the human values. When Krishna incarnated on earth, He also had three vows: I will be born again and again for the establishment of dharma; I will look after the welfare of those who think of Me; If you surrender to Me, I shall release you from all sins. 
When Sai incarnated, He also had three pledges. Which are these three pledges? Conferring joy on whole of humanity and protecting them – that is My vow. It is My love to remove the sufferings of the poor people by granting them what they lack. It is My pledge I will catch the hands of those who swerve from the path of dharma and bring them back to the path of dharma. From My birth till now, I have been leading My life in order to fulfil these three pledges. As was told by the previous speaker, My Life is My Message. It is not that His name is Sathya; the path I show is the path of Truth, the life that I demonstrate is a life of Truth, every word I teach is a word of Truth. Truth is My word and dharma is My path and ‘prema’ or love is My principle which I teach.
 If you want to develop love, it is necessary first you recognise the Truth. As long as we continue to have the sense of difference between myself and others, definitely we will be in the darkness of ignorance. But only when we experience, recognise the oneness of all creation, that is the time when we get rid of all sorrow, all attachments and all anguish. 
We have been listening a very good exposition of Krishna leelas. It is not only Krishna leelas, those days many Sai leelas also happened. When I was 14 year old, on the invitation of the Municipal Commissioner, I went to Hampi. Seshama Raju also came there with his wife. And the deity in Hampi is Virupaksha. Many people prayed to Me that I should also get in to the temple; I told them I am not going to come in to the temple, I will stay here, and stayed there outside. Seshama Raju had some wrong opinion about Me. He had a wrong opinion about Me, not exactly hatred; that He does not listen to me, he does not obey me and instead of serving the people inside the house, all the time He is thinking of helping people outside the house. His desire was becaue he was the elder brother and I am the younger brother, I should listen to him. Because Commissioner invited Me, I had to go there. They went inside the temple and offering worship to the deity. But all of them saw Sathyam standing there in the sanctum. Seshama Raju was very angry. “I called Him but he did not come; and now He has come there and standing inside the sanctum. He is very arrogant.” But that was not true. When he came outside and saw, he also saw I was sitting outside. And he was amazed to see there is Sathya inside the sanctum and there is Sathya outside the temple also. And Commissioner also saw that. Commisioner, because of his devotion to Me, he shed tears of joy, went on praising Me, “Sathya, you are not an ordinary person.” That was the first leela. The same Sathyam who is outside is also there inside. 
What happened at that point of time is also happening now. God is pervasive outside and inside: He is everywhere. Commissioner was so delighted, so happy; he wanted to give a gift to Me. He decided he would stitch four pairs of clothes and give it to Swami. But I told I am not going to accept anything from anybody; I don’t want anything. And even if people prayed to Him any number of times, I said that I am not going to accept it. 
Those days to have a collar-pin was a fashion. Commisioner’s wife prayed to Swami, “Swami, even if you don’t accept clothes from us, at least receive this collar-pin from me.” And because she went on praying, even Seshama Raju was angry. He also spoke to Me harshly saying, “Such a big Commissioner is telling you and you are not listening to him!” Because all of them put pressure on Me, I accepted that. I came back to Urvakonda with that collar-pin on my shirt collar. Because I was going from school to home, home to school, sometime it happened the collar-pin fell down somewhere. I was not sad that I lost the collar-pin. And keeping that collar-pin given by the Commissioner was a big job; I really didn’t care for it. I thought that collar-pin was a big burden because some day the Commissioner would come ask Me, “Where is the collar-pin that I gave you?” but collar-pin was lost. And illusion also was lost.
I called everybody, went to the garden of the Commissioner and sat on a rock. And there were the earliest devotees, Hanumantha Rao and Anjaneyulu; they also came there. All of them prayed to Me, “Instead of staying in the garden, please come to our house.” “I don’t have any relationships. I don’t have any attachments. I don’t have any family. I came for My devotees.” On 20th of October 1940, for the first time I taught this Truth. The same song many of our students were playing on very melodious instruments. That is Manasa bhaja re guru charanam, Dustara bhava saagara tharanam. Anjanaeyulu and his wife both of them came, sat at my feet and were singing this song. That is how the bhajan, bodhan – preaching and propagation of truth- that started.
First 16 years there were lot of leelas.  Next 16 years there were lot of miracles. During the period of the leelas, only people around Me knew about Me. In the next 16 years during the period of miracles, lot of people came from all around including the king of Mysore, the queen of Chincholi  and Coffee Sakamma. Now you are able to see all the programmes here all over the world through the streaming facility; but those days this kind of technology or ‘trick-knowledge’ was not there.  Just in the same way as I appeared in the sanctum of Virupaksha temple, I manifested in many houses of My devotees and called all of them to Me. They don’t know where is Puttaparthi. Those days buses were also very rare. From Dharmavaram there was only one bus to Karnatanagapalli. With great difficulty, people would come there. If you want to cross over the Chithravathi river from Karnatanagapalli, you should use a bullock cart or walk. Even the queen of Mysore came there in a car upto Karnatanagapalli; but later, she had to walk all the distance.
People from outside – lot of them-came and were trusting Me, were believing in Me but not the people around. People of the village were always doubting - this boy who is born in our village, people are saying He is God; is it possible? But people from outside came with great devotion to Swami; they wanted to build a temple for Swami. First and foremost, Subbamma gave me one acre of land. In front of Satyabhama temple, she gave me one acre of land and there they put a tin shed and called it the mandir. Even when I was in that old mandir, number of devotees went on rising. And because of the rise in the number of devotees, many devotees from around, especially Vittal Rao of Bangalore, they purchased ten acres of land and now the Prashanti Nilayam was built. It started in a small way but now it is known all over the world.
Even when I told my sisters Venkamma and Parvathamma, they never believed Me. When I started telling them that from all over the world, people will come to Puttaparthi, and this will become a big pilgrimage centre, they thought that I was mad. Just because just fifteen twenty people are coming, Sathya is growing horns, He is feeling very proud. And He is already telling us from the old mandir we should go to the new mandir. Not only that, apart from the Prashanti Nilayam itself, He is purchasing lands around and building big mansions. But none of them believed whatever I said.
One day I was sitting on the chair of my brother, Seshamma Raju; he was very angry, he came with a stick and beat me up. He was a school teacher. He was very angry. “You are just a small boy, I am a school teacher. How dare you come and sit on my chair?” Then I told him, “A time will come. You are going to get a silver chair for Me in future and I will sit on it majestically and you will come and see that.”Even that happened. Whatever I said, people were not able to believe
Eshwaramma also was very hasty and she came and told Me, “Sathyam, I don’t know how great you are but you are my son. And there are lot of people coming and inviting you to outside places; but you should stay here only. You should not go anywhere.” Then I told her, “Eshwaramma, as long as this body is there, I will not leave Puttaparthi and go.” And she was very much pacified and she was very happy to hear that. Whether it is Eshwaramma or anybody else, they were all very fortunate people. Because of their devotion to God and all the kinds of offerings of worship they did, they got God Himself as the son of that family.  To think that their family was a very ordinary family is a mistake.
Why am I telling all this to the audience now? Because many students have come from many campuses today. They don’t know about this; I am telling My own story to them. 
When I built the mandir, nobody believed me. They asked me, “Why are you building such a big mandir?” And you are becoming more and more arrogant and spending more and more money. I told them, “Not only this mandir t very huge mandir will come up. Even that will not be enough.”
Whatever happened at that point of time, now also is happening.  Three years back when I came to Muddenahalli, I told Narasimhamurthy, “Don’t think this is a small educational institution. It is going to be transformed into a big ashram. And people from all over the world would come to this ashram. And huge programmes will happen here. We are going to build a huge auditorium and a bhajan hall.” In the same way as those people did not believe Me at that point of time, he also did not believe Me. Now he has got faith. I have been telling him, “You have been here for 40 years and the same buildings are there. But why so many people are coming now and not before? They are not coming here for your sake; because Sai Baba is here, they are coming. Because of the magnetic attraction of God, all the devotees are coming here. There is no need to tell the bees where the flowers have blossomed. There is no need for inviting the bees to a flower. Wherever there is a flower, bees will swarm there. Nobody need to tell ants where the sugar is; ants will come to the sugar anyway. Nobody need tell others that God is there and here. Devotees definitely will come to God.”
I said yesterday also, “The magnetic power of God is here. Because of the rust and dust of ego and attachment, we are not getting attracted to God. When we get rid of ego and attachment and develop devotion, automatically we will be attracted to God.” Cowherd boys and girls said, “Krishna is not ours but we belong to Krishna.” But yadavas with the voice of authority, went on declaring, “Krishna belongs to us.” One side is self surrender, other side is authority and ego. God will never be won by either ego and ostentation. Wherever there is self surrender, God will go there.
You may believe it or not, I want to tell you now. This place is a very meritorious place. It is a land of penance. And all this area was there in the Vishwamitra ashrama in Treta yuga. Rama and Lakshmana came here, fought against Thataki, and killed lot of demons. It is not right on our part to think that this place is a very ordinary place. To think that people here are very ordinary people is also a mistake. In the same way as same Rama came as Krishna, same Krishna came as Sai, people around Him who love Him, who adore Him, they will also be born again and again. Even before Rama was born, the seven sages – saptarishis- came there to Ayodhya. Lot of people were amazed to find that great sages are coming to Ayodhya though nothing is happening here. Even king Dasharatha was surprised to see all the great sages were coming there though there was nothing extraordinary happening there. But they knew that God would come down as Sri Rama in Ayodhya which Dasharatha himself did not know. And in future you are going to see, the whole place will be full of saints and sages. Wherever you see, you will see the ochre robes and the orange clothes. Lot of great devotees, great saints and sages will come over here. Not only that, people adorning high positions of authority like Presidents and ministers – all of them will come here. Therefore our students should not think that we are studying in a small educational institution. It is a sacred and noble ashrama. Wherever there is no ‘shrama’ or labour, that is ashrama. Where there is love, there is no trouble. When you develop love, you will not have any trouble. All of you should invite and welcome all those people who come here with great love and sincerity.
Subbamma was getting up at 4 o’ clock in the morning; all the time preparing food for the devotees who gathered there. Those days there were no hotels. And early morning she would get up and start working - preparing the food - and she would be doing it till eleven in the night. “Why are you taking so much trouble?” “This is not any trouble for me, this is bliss. You have given me this great opportunity, what else do I need? I am doing it out of my joy; don’t think that I am taking some trouble.”
Therefore whoever comes to the ashram, all of you should receive them, welcome them with love and devotion. The devotees come here not for gaining any respect; they come here for love. I don’t have a physical body now, but through your bodies, I work. All the hands and legs belong to God; all the heads, eyes and ears; and He envelops everything. All your hands are My hands. All your eyes are My eyes. All your ears are My ears. You should know that your body does not really belong to you; it is Swami’s body and keep it sacred and pure.
Athi Rudra Maha Yajna is a sacred time. It is a time of transition. Kali yuga is ending and Sathya yuga is beginning. It is not Sathya yuga; it is Prema yuga, yuga of love. When we know the truth everybody belongs to us, we naturally develop love. When you look at your own reflection in the mirror, you love it and take delight. Because you know that the reflection is also yourself. And when you think, looking at others, they are different, I am different, you can’t develop love. But there is only one Truth and people speak it in many ways. Only when you know that Sai is in everybody and everybody is the embodiment of Sai, you will develop love. And when you develop love, you also experience bliss. Everything is love, love and love. Therefore only if you develop love, you can understand the Sai principle.	
Swami has come here, thousands of people are coming here; they are regarding us, respecting us; thinking that way, you should not develop pride. A tree with fruits will always be lying low. Humility is very important. With humility and obedience, you have to love everyone. 
Here lodging facilities are not good enough. I am going to build more and more houses here to accommodate the devotees and also I will create all the facilities required for them. Next year all kinds of canteens will start here. Apart from canteens, hospital also will come here. For people staying here, all kinds of comforts and facilities will be available here itself. 
You can go and see a big hall is being built. To think that this hall is being built for Swami, is not complete truth. Swami is definitely here; it is not only Swami, in future Prema Sai is going to come and grant His darshan in that hall. Narasimha Murthy was asking Me, “Swami, do we need such a big hall?” “If you want to give darshan, that hall is not required; but if I give darshan, I need a bigger hall.” You have to do it for My sake. I am giving them a lot of work.  Only when I give lot of work, they think of Me. When they think the task is impossible, then they think of God. And many small projects they can do themselves without thinking of Me. When I give them big projects, naturally they will come to Me and pray to Me, “Swami, you have to help us. You have to grant us strength.” And among a lot of devotees this is a kind of fear that leads to devotion.  That is bhaya and bhakthi – fear and devotion. Architects and engineers are working very hard in order to complete this buildings on time. All of you are sitting here, listening to talks, enjoying prasadam and see the yajna happening; but those engineers and architects they never came here even one day. All the time they are working. And not only they, our boys are also joining them in their work. Even the engineers and also the students are doing the work thinking that, “It is not somebody’s work, it is Swami’s work,” and therefore, they are working with love. When I went and saw the hall a few days back, even I could not believe whether it could happen. Now I have gained complete faith that because our students are working, it will be complete. Because they are doing the work, because they think it is the sacred work of Swami, we should do it with love. Children have very great faith. When Krishna wanted to lift up the hill of Govardhana, all the cowherds there came saying, “We will also help you, Krishna, we will also join you in your work.” Even a small stone, children cannot lift; but when child Krishna told them, “I am going to lift up the whole hill,” all of them came without doubting, with  complete faith. Nobody questioned Me, “You are a small boy. How can you lift the hill? How can we help you? OK, by any chance if we can lift it up, if it falls on our head, we will be crushed. What will happen to us? Nobody questioned us.” There were no doubts at all. Krishna has said; therefore it is going to happen; therefore, all of us should join that work.
Therefore, when I tell MY student, “There is lot of work.” All of them are coming, “Swami, we will definitely join you in the work.” The boys in other campuses are feeling bad, “We should also join the work, we should also get the opportunity to do service.” When Rama built the huge bridge, great bridge even a squirrel came there to help. And it was filling its body with sand and would take it and put it on the bridge. The squirrel also thought, “When such a great task is happening, I should not keep quiet. I should also do the service.” When such great tasks are being achieved, for you to simply sit, is not correct. Not delighting just looking at it; but do the thing and take delight.”
When you offer all your work, all that you do for the love of God, then you can recognise the Truth. Sathya Sai avatar will continue to be there for some years. But after some time, I will come back as Prema Sai, stay in this ashram and grant my darshan and even teaching of Truth. Even a farmer, even before the rains come, he will till the land and keep it ready; in the same way I am preparing the place. Not only I am getting ready the place, I am also cultivating your hearts. I am waiting to remove selfishness and self-interest from your hearts and sow the seeds of love. When the rain comes, then it will be useful. Taking a part in this kind of huge task, you also make your life’s fulfilment.

Embodiments of Divine Love!
The body is the basis of all noble and charitable activity. We should know why we are given the human body, why did we come here with the human body. This human body is not just a machine which is made up of five elements and which has many organs. It is not just a machine but it is an instrument and a very worthy instrument. But without knowing the purpose why we have got the human body, we are spoiling it with many worldly and sensual pleasures. For any vehicle, there needs to be a driver; similarly for the vehicle of the human body also there is a driver. If you get a good driver, the driver will take you to the destination after driving you there very smoothly and correctly. The right driver follows all the rules of the traffic and he will see to it that you will not meet with any danger of an accident and finally, he will lead you to the destination. If you have got a good driver, even the master of the car can sit in the car, even sleep, and finally reach the destination very safely. If the master wants to reach a particular destination, it is not enough if he just wishes, a car is also required. Even if the car is there, it is not enough; a good driver is also required.
That is why I keep saying, “You are not one, but three.” 
The body is what you think you are. You think you are the body with a particular name and a form; you imagine that that is the truth. Not at all. Body belongs to you, but you are not the body. The car belongs to you, but you are not the car. 
The second is what others think you are. When people look at you, how you conduct yourself, they look at your behaviour, they listen to your words, then they develop a particular image of yourself. Even that is untrue. It is inescapable that we behave according to the place, time and circumstances. In one situation you behave in one way; in another situation naturally it has to change. In a particular situation, when they look at you they develop a particular opinion. In a different situation, when they once again watch, looking at your different behaviour they will develop a different opinion about you. When a teacher goes to the classroom and teaches, then we can think he is a teacher. Just because he is doing the job of a teacher teaching lessons in the classroom, we call him a teacher. When he goes back home and plays with his children, then we call him a father. When he meets a friend, he won’t behave like a teacher, he won’t behave like a father; he behaves like a friend. They look at him in the school, they call him a teacher; those who look at him at home call him a father; those who look at him with a friend call him a friend. The behaviour depends on the situation but you can’t call it as truth. Then who is he?
What you think you are is only the body; what others think you are is your mind. What you really are, what is your true nature that is the divine nature. When you consider your human body as a car, the driver is the mind and the master is the atma itself. When atma is the master, naturally the mind has to obey the master that is the atma. It is not right for the mind to take up the mastership. As the master says, the driver has to drive the car. Driver cannot be disobedient to the master. That is why ‘Master the mind, be a master mind’. The driver has to do the service to the owner by listening to him and obeying him. It is not right for the driver to command the master. Just because mind is the driver for the car of the body, we are able to do so many things. As long as the driver drives the car in a righteous way, in a proper way, there won’t be any accidents. As long as the driver obeys the master’s command and drives it properly, there won’t be any danger. When you have a bad driver, many kinds of accidents can take place. Therefore it is very essential that you clean up the mind in the right way. We have to see to it that our mind is a good driver and not a bad driver. When the driver i.e. the mind keeps listening to the master i.e. the atma, then the body will become a means for all righteous activity. 
But it is not right for us to accuse the body. When a car meets with an accident the responsibility is of the driver. Car cannot go anywhere by itself. Because car is inert.  Only when the driver starts the car and drives it, then the car can move. Therefore, mind is the basis of all the creation. When you make the mind pure, sacred and noble, then the mind also will drive the body in the right way and take it to the right destination.
But mind has some impurities also. The first is the ego. When there is an egoistic driver he won’t listen to the master. Only when he listens to the master he pretends to obey but he does not obey. When master sleeps in the car the driver goes his own way. When you forget God even for a moment, the mind takes over the mastership. Even when you gain a lot of wealth, even when you ride horses or elephants, when people praise you to the skies, never ever forget the name of God even for a moment. Accidents happen when we forget God.
In the epic of Mahabharata a very atrocious incident of humiliation of Draupadi took place. Many people ask a question, “Draupadi was a great devotee of Krishna, and also Pandavas had a very sweet and strong relationship with Krishna; why did Krishna not see to it that they did not play the game of dice and Draupadi was subjected to such disgrace?” When Duryodhana invited Dharmaraja for the game of dice, it is not that Dharmaraja did not know. The maternal uncle of Duryodhana, Shakuni, was a a very wicked person. And he also knew that this Shakuni could play a game of dice without losing it. Some people keep doubting, “Even after knowing the wickedness of Shakuni, why did Dharmaraja go for the game of dice, why did not Krishna stop him from going? If Krishna really loved the Pandavas, why did he not stop them from doing it, why did he not save them from this humiliation?” 
Dharmaraja did not invite Krishna to find out what Krishna felt about this. In the same way as Duryodhana consulted Shakuni for the game of dice, if Dharmaraja also had also consulted Krishna, definitely Dharmaraja would have won the game. Ultimately in the battle of Mahabharata, five brothers, Pandavas, won over the hundred brothers, Kauravas; if that could happen, could not Krishna make Dharmaraja win the game of dice? Since Dharmaraja forgot Krishna, he did not seek His advice; he played the game of dice and lost the game of dice and lost everything along with that.
Another name for Draupadi is Krishna. She is a great devotee. But at that time she did not think of Krishna even for a moment. She first prayed to Dharmaraja and all the Pandavas to rescue her. When Dharmaraja and Pandavas did not come to her rescue, she prayed to Bheeshma and other elders in the royal scourt. When even the elders in the royal court did not come to her rescue, she tried to rescue herself and protect herself with her own strength. But she could not come to her own rescue. But finally when she lost all hope, she thought of Krishna and prayed to Krishna, then spontaneously a miracle took place. The sari became inexhaustible and it saved her honour. If after having lost everything what is the use of thinking of Krishna? Only if Pandavas had thought of Krishna before, had sought His advice while they were invited for the game of dice, all these things would not have happened. Just because they did not think of Krishna at that point of time, they had to undergo all these difficulties and humiliation.
When we meet with difficulties, we naturally think of God. Even during times of happiness we think of God, why will the difficulties come to us? In our happiness we forget God, think of God only during difficulties; that is why our life becomes a combination of happiness and sorrow. If the driver drives the car in his own way and meets with an accident, then he asks the help of the master, what is the use? If the driver listens to the master who advises him to drive slowly and he drives slowly, then there won’t be any accident.
Similarly, mind full of ego does not listen to the heart. When the heart talks to the mind, mind just pretends to obey but does not. Mind is a good servant but a bad master. It is highly dangerous for us to make the mind our master. Finally, always, the true master is our atma. That is the heart. That is the residence of God. And if you want to lead a very righteous life, use the body well, use the senses well and walk the path of righteousness, then you have to see to it that you master the mind first. 
It is not that you can master the mind at one time; you need to practise it continuously. We could not walk or talk or eat when we were just born. By gradual practise we are able to do all this. First the mind will not listen to the heart. By gradual practice it is possible for us to control the mind also. “Kaunteya, son of Kunti! You can control the mind with practise and detachment.” When you keep using your discrimination, what is true what is untrue, what is temporary what is permanent, you make your mind follow the truth, then finally you will be able to control your mind. When you use your right hand always, right hand becomes strong. For those who use their left hand, left hand becomes stronger. For people who use only their minds, mind becomes stronger. But for those who use their heart, heart becomes stronger. 
When you listen to the heart, when you listen to the voice of the atma, naturally your spiritual power goes on increasing. The mind is always external and goes outward always. That is the path of the pleasant or the ‘preyas’. The mind always keeps on struggling for that which is pleasant and which is happy. The mind will never discriminate whether it is truth or untruth, good or bad. All the time mind struggles to attain some temporary, momentary happiness.
But heart is not like that. That is the path of the ‘shreyas’ and good. Heart always tells us what is good for us, what will bring us good name and fame. Even the heart of Ravana advised him but he did not listen to his heart, he listened only to his mind. That is why he met with such a grave downfall. Not only himself, he ruined his family, his progeny, and whole of his kingdom. But Vibheeshana was not like that. Vibheeshana used his discrimination, found out what was wrong and what was right and he took to the right side. When Vibheeshana found out that his elder brother, Ravana, was on the wrong path, he gave him up and joined Rama on the other side.
In Mahabharata we have a character, Bheeshma, the grand-sire. Even after knowing what was right and what was wrong, Bheeshma was on the wrong side. Because he followed his mind, finally he was subjected to a very cruelsome death. 
Therefore for all of us it is necessary whether what is talking to us – our mind or the heart – and then follow the heart. How do you know whether your mind is talking to you or your heart is talking to you? The mind goes after only those pleasant things. But heart always tells you to follow the right thing, the good path. Mind always tell you things which are very selfish. All the time it is thinking of ‘I’ and ‘mine’. But heart has the broadmindedness of ‘we’ and ‘ours’. Mind does everything for its selfishness and self-interest. But heart does it with a broadmindedness that everybody should be happy, and all the people in all worlds should be happy. When we follow the mind, we don’t get peace of mind. But when you listen to the heart and follow its advice, immediately you will get peace of mind. Peace you can gain only through the heart. If you follow the mind, you will only get into pieces and pieces.
Gopikas – the cowherd girls- loved Krishna with all their heart; therefore, He blessed them and conferred them with great blessing. Yadavas followed only their minds. They thought Krishna was a father or a grand-father or a son-in-law or an uncle; that is why all of them were ruined ultimately. Just because of one proud thought, one arrogant thought came into the minds of the gopis, Krishna also went away from them for a while. But when they cried for Krishna and ultimately surrendered completely to Krishna, Krishna again manifested for them But He is not the external Krishna. They saw Krishna within themselves. 
And in the same way sometimes God will not manifest and you will not be able to see Him. But His purpose is not to punish the devotees. He has only one aspiration that devotees should look for Him inside and not outside. Even now that is the drama I am doing. When you go and look for God outside, you can’t get Him. When you purify your heart, Sai manifests there as the resident of your heart. God will manifest only in that heart which does not have a trace of selfishness and self-interest and has selflessness. Therefore you have to develop that pure heart. Other things come and go. ‘Ja-gat’ means the things come and go. The tree which is born in soil will become soil one day or the other. The creation which has come from Brahma will ultimately become Brahma. But for your vision it may look different. O brave son of Bharat, listen to this wisdom. Everything is one and one. Only when you base your life on the atma, you will see only atma everywhere. Therefore it is highly essential that you purify your minds. Mind is full of selfishness and selfishness. Heart always looks for selflessness and God.
A lot of people come here and tell Me, “Swami, You are here. We also want to see You.” It’s a great thing that the formless God manifested with a form. But this divine incarnation, after leaving the physical body, came back in the subtle body; but such a thing never happened in the history of mankind. If you want to experience this wonderful phenomenon how much pure your heart should be. When I was in the physical body, even very ignorant students I kept them passing. Even they when they came with very little devotion, I granted them My darshan and blessed them. But now only for those people with absolutely pure hearts they can have the darshan, sparshan, and sambhashan.
When gopikas, the cowherd girls, prayed to Krishna, “We want you alone and nothing else,” only then they could get Krishna. They did not say, “We want you also,” they said, “We want only you.” When you want this world, you want everything in this world, and then you want God also, you can’t get God. Only when you feel, “I want only God,” definitely you will get God and everything else. Mind keeps frightening you all the time. The mind thinks when you get God, you will lose everything else. That is not the truth at all. When you get God you will get everything else. Therefore you should pray, “I want only God.” You should not pray, “I want also God.” “I want only God. Only God. Only God. Only God.” When whole-heartedly you pray like that, God will always be behind you. If you remove everything else from the mind, fill your mind only with the thoughts of God, when you pray, “I want only God,” definitely you will be able to attain God. 
Those people who are managing these institutions are men of great merit and punya. They don’t have any narrow-mindedness; they want only Swami and nothing else. “Only Swami is enough for us.” That is why they found Swami. I always keep saying, “Yes, yes” for everything. If you want money, “Yes.” If you want children, “Yes.” If you want name and fame, “Yes.” If people tell Me, “Swami, we want only You,” even for that I say, “Yes.” Therefore if you want only God, you will definitely get God.
Badri is coming here and expounding the wonderful love of gopis for Krishna; but nobody can understand their love. That is an absolutely pure love. They wanted only Krishna and their mind is full of Krishna; the mind was bereft of anything else. Just because the gopikas love Krishna so dearly, they did not have any worldly wealth or worldly glory; even today we are talking of them because of their great devotion.
My dear students! Tomorrow you will become very educated people and get big jobs and become big people. Many engineers have come and gone, many doctors have come and gone, many lawyers have come and gone, many rich people have come and gone; but all of them have just joined the dust-bins of history. Only the devotees are remembered today. Only truth and good name are always remembered. If you want to become a part of parcel of Baba’s life, Bhagawan’s life, it is not enough you just become engineers or doctors; you have to develop great devotion and become great devotees. Even today we do not know who are the relatives, what is the number of relatives that Rama had; but even today we remember with the help of monkeys, He could build a bridge across the ocean. Nobody knows how many wives Krishna had, who were the children and who were his grand-children. But even today we remember that cowherd boys and girls were dearest to Krishna.
Swami has many children, innumerable devotees; but only those devotees and children who walk in the foot-steps of Swami, will be remembered forever. My footsteps are love and service. You walk in My footsteps and come behind Me. You utilise your body and senses very well, your mind very well with the only desire for Swami, you walk behind Me. This kind of opportunity is not given to everyone. Therefore the opportunity which you have got, you use it well. You have obtained Sai; don’t lose Him again; and make your path smooth. Nobody will get this opportunity again. Therefore all of you run, dash for the service to the feet of Sai. Wake up. Wake up from ignorance.",10/21/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
20,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 10 Discourse,"The water bubble emerges from water, lives on water, and finally merges in water. Similarly man is the water bubble and God Himself is the water. This is the Truth. This is the word of Sai, the path of Truth.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
In the same way as a water bubble is born in water, is sustained in water, and finally goes back into water, the whole universe is nothing but such a bubble which has come out of the vast ocean of God, which is sustained by God, ultimately goes back to God. This world which is transient, temporary, and just physical is also a creation of God who is eternal, who is permanent, and who is ever present. Waves are born from the waters of the ocean; they come and go. Similarly, all the universes come and go with the basis as God. The transient, fickle waves arise out of the permanent and steady ocean. All these waves are nothing but a limb of the ocean itself. 
Our Upanishads declare based on this Truth, that there is God is pervading both inside and outside everything. There is no way you can say, “This is God and this is not God.” Because everything is nothing but God Himself. It is highly essential that we recognise this truth. As long as we live in the darkness of ignorance, of untruth, till then we are subjected to all kinds of miseries, sorrows, trials and tribulations. At a time when there were no street lights in this Muddenahalli, when boys were moving around on the road, in the darkness when they saw a rope, there were so much frightened thinking that it was a serpent.  Because of our illusion, to think that that rope is nothing but a snake, we are frightened. But when lights shine on the road we see the truth and we lose our fear. When you recognise the truth that everything in this universe is God Himself, you will not have any sorrow, you will not have any attachment, you will not have any anguish. But in the darkness of selfishness and self-interest it is most difficult to recognise this truth. Only when man develops selflessness and when the selflessness sheds its light on your path, you will be able to recognise the truth.
These times are very, very sacred. One yuga is ending, another yuga is starting. ‘Kali’ or ‘Kali yuga’ means an age of darkness. What is this darkness? In spite of so many electric lights shining, where do you get this darkness? It is not external darkness, it is internal darkness. This internal darkness is nothing but the sense of duality that envelops us. Therefore, at this time of darkness to recognise this truth is very difficult. When you want to traverse the path in the darkness of the night, you are not able to see anything; therefore, it is very difficult for you. But while moving in a car you can put on the car lights and move on the road. Car lights have an extent of light they can shed, there is a limitation; but in that limitation you can still keep moving on the road. Many men of sacrifice, nobility, men of yoga and men of penance have lit the lamps of love in their hearts and shedding that light on the path so that everybody can see. 
But within a short time, Kali yuga will end and Sathya yuga will begin. In the same way as day is inevitable after the night, after the Kali yuga will come the Sathya yuga. When the sun of wisdom rises and sheds its light, then it is easy for us to traverse the path. Even very ordinary people at that point of time will be able to enter the spiritual path and move forward.
But there should be someone who guides on the path. Only when we know our destination - where we are going- only then we can move forward. If you get into the Chikkaballapur bus-stand, if you want to go to Bangalore, you have to purchase a ticket in a bus going to Bangalore. If you want to go to Hyderabad, you have to purchase the ticket for Hyderabad. When you know where exactly you have to go, immediately you can start your journey. Man without knowing his destination, today he is drifting in darkness, in complete confusion. That is the time when divine incarnations and many men of penance and yoga will come up to light up the path of the people to show them the right destination.
Yoga is not just confined or related only to the body. Many times I have told the students, “You are not one but three. The one you think you are - that is the body. The one others think you are – that is the mind. The one you really are - that is the atma principle. Yoga is required for all the three constituents of the human personality. Because of the power of all the three constituents, man is able to lead his life. You need to have physical strength; you also should have intellectual strength; and most importantly what is required is the power of the heart or the spiritual power. 
And in our scriptures it is depicted as the Mother Goddess manifesting in the forms of three – Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati. The physical power is Durga. The mental and intellectual power is Saraswati. The spiritual power is Lakshmi. Lakshmi does not mean just material wealth and possessions and comforts and luxuries. What is our true wealth? Bliss is our true wealth. And it is Lakshmi who confers on us this bliss. That is how we pray to Lakshmi as the Goddess of Moksha, Moksha Lakshmi. 
Yoga is definitely required for us. I am telling you about yoga which is related to your body, mind and atma. 
The first is “Yogaha karma sukoushalam.”  Perfection in action is yoga. Whatever you do, if you do it perfectly it is transformed into yoga. And today we saw the young people from outside the country, from other countries came and chanted the veda. Because they got an opportunity to chant veda in the divine presence of Swami, they put in a great, sincere effort. Why are they practising? They had only desire: we have to chant the veda perfectly in the presence of Swami. When we offer all our actions and do all our actions perfectly and offer it for the love of God, then all actions will turn into yoga. Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever yajna you perform, whatever thing you give in charity, all that offer it to Me. The body is the basis of all noble and charitable activities.  This body is nothing but a boat given to us to cross over the ocean of samsara. When the boat has some holes in it, definitely you can’t traverse by that boat. Therefore it is very essential we protect the strength and stamina of the body. Either for achieving any of the four goals of dharma, artha, kama, and moksha, health of the body is very important. Definitely we can pray to God for good health of the body; at the same time, practising yoga you can maintain your physical strength and stamina. And when you offer all your actions, whatever you do to God with love for God then every action will turn into yoga. Love has no expectations. Really the perfect actions are nothing but selfless actions. That action which has no reaction is the only perfect action and not other actions. When you do something desirelessly – all desire actions have no reaction. Every action will bring its consequence. But those actions which we offer to God with love, they won’t bring in any reactions. Desireless and you are detached from everything and you don’t have any worries. When you offer everything to God, there is only one reaction. And the reaction is the divine grace that descends on you. There won’t be any attachments. Whatever actions we undertake with this body, when we offer them to God with love, every action itself will become yoga.
There is a very intimate and subtle relationship between body and mind. The relationship is inseparable. Depending on the body, mind is shaped. And similarly depending on the mind, the body is shaped. Body is like a vessel. And the water in the vessel is the mind. When the body is moving, vessel is moving, the water also will be moving. Through practice of yoga you can make the body steady to a very great extent. When the body becomes steady, mind also becomes steady. In the same way as water remains steady in a steady vessel, in a steady body, steady mind will be there. Depending on this, our scriptures have said yoga is nothing but subduing all the vibrations in the mind. The mind is always moving and fickle. And mind is by nature very fickle. But by practice of yoga to a great extent you will be able to control the mind. If you want to control the thought vibrations in your mind, ‘yogabhayasa’ – practice of yoga – is very necessary. 
True yoga is not just attaining the steadiness and stamina of the body, and not even the little control over the mind, but most important is attaining equanimity of mind in all situations. That is why it is said Samatwa itself is yoga – equanimity is yoga.
There are three things you can attain through yoga – first is you will be able to do perfect actions, second is you will be able to control the mind and thirdly, you will attain equanimity of mind in all situations. This equanimity of mind is nothing but the atma principle. A yogi is always having a contented mind. Whatever may happen to him in the life, he knows and he thinks and believes that everything is happening according to the will of God; therefore he will maintain his equanimity of mind. But to think that yoga is related only to yogasanas of the body, is not correct. Through yogabhyasa you can make your body steady; therefore, mind also steady. When your mind becomes steady, you will be able to recognise the atma principle. In moving waters you can’t see your reflection. Therefore it is not possible in the fickle mind to see the steady atma. 
And if we want to achieve anything like this, first thing is you should love God and offer everything to God.
Food, sleep, procreation and fear are common both to animals and human beings. Only dharma is that which distinguishes human beings from animals. Dharma is not religion – to say Hindu dharma or Christian dharma or Muslim dharma. The true dharma is atma dharma. It is the divine dharma. And what is atma dharma is nothing but helping others. Utilising our body, senses, mind and our spiritual power to love everybody, to serve everybody – that is real dharma. That is our real nature.
 And rivers flow for helping others; the trees yield fruits for helping others; the cows yield milk for helping others; the body is given to us to help others. In the word ‘paropakara’, there are three things – ‘para’, ‘upa’ and ‘kara’. ‘Para’ means the God principle. There are two things – ‘para’ and ‘apara’. ‘Para’ are those actions which we involve in to help others and serve God – that is really ‘para’. ‘Upa’ means take you near. ‘Kara’ means that does it. What is ‘paropakara’? ‘Paropakara’ s that action which takes us nearer to God. And there is only one destination for us - that is ‘yoga’. ‘Ya’ means that, He; ‘gam’ means to go; ‘Yoga’ means ‘to reach Him’. Real yoga is merging in God. That is what we need to do.
Students and all devotees! It is necessary we take to the practice of yoga, make the body strong and steady, thereby make the mind steady and finally, recognise our divine nature. Even if you not able to do anything ,if you do a little pranayama or beathing exercise, you will be able to control your mind to a great extent. ‘Prana’ and ‘pranayama’ have a close connection. And there are five life principles that flow in the body. This prana is connected with breath. That is what we call ‘prana vayu’.
When we do the inhalation and exhalation the mind derives power from that. When our mind is peaceful, our inhalation and exhalation are very slow. And mind becomes fickle, the breathing also becomes fickle. You see all of you know when you get angry your inhalation exhalation are very quick and fast. It is like the work of a railway engine - the inhalation exhalation takes place. When the mind is peaceful, when you get into a satsang like this, when you listen to God’s glory. singing about God, then the mind becomes peaceful and the breath becomes very slow and steady. Through the body we inhale and exhale but through that we will be able to control the mind also. When your mind is unsteady and fickle, when you control your breath, you will be able to control the mind also. And in the ultimate state of Samadhi, communion with God even breathing will stop. Because there is no mind in that state. There is connection between mind and wind. When mind ultimately merges or vanishes, then actually there is connection between mind and breathing; finally there won’t be any breathing at all.
Many great souls have come here today and they are telling you such wonderful, noble things – all of you should learn them. And even Dr. Nagendra also has a yoga guru. Without guru, you don’t gain wisdom. All that he spoke here today he has learnt from his guru. In obedience to his guru, he has taken upon himself the mission of spreading love and sacrifice. He has a single pointed mission of this yoga and he has not got any family encumbrances; all the time he is involved in his work. Whole world is his family. For broad minded people, the whole world is their family. And we have to think that everybody belongs to us.
If you want to attain the divine consciousness and enjoy that bliss, first you have to move from ‘I’ to ‘We’, from ‘my’ to ‘ours’. ‘I’ to ‘We’ to ‘He’ – that is the journey. In three steps we can reach the ultimate goal. First we have to give up the selfishness of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ and move to become selfless and helping others. From helping others, finally you go to the divine principle. From ‘svaartha’ to ‘paraartha’, from ‘paraartha’ to ‘paramaarthaa’. From individual to society to God. 
Why we are building so many institutions? The purpose is not just to give medicines to a few people. It is not just giving free education to some children. It is not just we give drinking water to some villages. And it is my desire when we take up such gigantic projects, many people get opportunity to move away from selfishness and develop selflessness. That is My desire. And once you give up selfishness and become selfless, you have attained the divine principle. God plus desire equals man. Man minus desire equals God. That is what is desirelessness. And you are always pure and able. You should also have the competence to do things.
Already it is very late I don’t want to speak for much more time. And I have a great desire that all the students will make good use of these opportunities. And here are students from all our institutions – Muddenahalli, Chikaballapur, Gulbarga, Jaipura, Mandya, Alike, Bagalkot and Bijapur. 
Next year we are going to start an educational campus in Hassan district also. Already our people have gone to Hassan and registered the agreements for the land and they are applying for permission to stat the school. The name is Sri Sathya Sai Sathya Niketanam. The next June Sri Sathya Sai Sathya Niketanam will start functioning in the Hassan district. All of you should help this cause and see that is happens. 
My dears, you can see all the elders are very aged and they don’t have the strength of body. The mind is strong but the body is weak. That is natural. But there are lot of things that you have to do. And now your hands are strong, head is strong and also heart is strong; use all these powers to serve the society. 
The goal of education is not eking out our livelihood. Education is for life, not for a mere living. You get only useless knowledge and get into argumentation by learning that kind of education which will not give you light. What is the use of learning all education which ultimately leads you to death? You have to learn that education which will lead you to immortality. That is the atma vidya or spiritual education. That is selfless education. That is what you have to learn. 
You are all very fortunate people. And so many teachers and elders have got together to help you here. And because of their good work, so many devotes are also able to gather here. All these people are even selling their properties and offering it at the altar of the fire of selfless service. Even if this magnificent yaaga and yajna had to take place, one family from Kerala, they sold all their properties, offered it at the Lotus Feet of Swami. And when such selfless programs and projects take place, all other should also develop that selfless feeling. In this kind of work, the government, the people, the children, elders, everybody should get together. You can achieve anything with unity.
I aspire that all of you utilise the opportunities given to you, put them to good use. The Navarathri celebrations are coming to an end. 
Tomorrow is the day when Kali yuga ends and Sathya yuga begins.",10/22/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
21,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam 2015 Day 11 Discourse,"God shines forth in His Creation all the time and the world shines forth in God. The relationship between God and this Creation is inseparable.
Embodiments of the Divine Atma!
The relationship between God and His Creation, between Purusha and Prakriti, between Shiva and Shakthi, between God and His devotees is inseparable. Wherever there is an object, naturally there will be a reflection. Similarly wherever there is God, there are His devotees.
All of you have gathered in such wonderful congregation; for all that, there is only one reason. I am the reason. It is not anybody else who called all of you here; I called each and every one of you here. And whatever has happened here is filling every heart with so much of amazing and unimaginable bliss. In the same way as a mother’s heart is flooded with love when she sees her children, My heart is overflowing with love looking at all of you here. 
I don’t want to speak much now. 
If such a mammoth function had to happen here, many, many devotees have got together, worked day and night and made it possible. But if I want to tell you the truth, it is not that you did; through your bodies I did all My work. I did not do it for anybody else; I did it for Myself. Because everyone is Myself, Myself. This truth I know; but you have to know it, you have to recognise it. Now I do not have a body made up of five elements. In this world which is made up of five elements, if somebody wants to do anything, a body made up of five elements is required. But today I don’t have such a physical body. All your bodies are my bodies, all your hands are my hands, all your sights are my hands, all your paths are my paths, and all your actions are my actions.
Earlier it was only one Sai Baba. Now many, many Sai Babas will manifest through you and demonstrate the truth of oneness of everyone. Truly Sai Baba has no name, no form. His true nature, truth, reality is only love and nothing else. When you develop that kind of selfless love, speak to everyone with love, serve everyone with love then the whole world will see Me in everyone of you and realise the truth.
I don’t have any desires. But there is only one desire for which I always keep working. The only one thing is that develop love like Me, and also you also become an embodiment of love. That is My desire.
All the words that are spoken by Swami are words of truth. All the time I am addressing you as embodiments of love, embodiments of atma. And all of you have one great responsibility. You should never swerve from the path I am laying down through my words. Your responsibility is to experience and practise and propagate My principle of love. Then all the people of the world looking at the devotees of Sai Baba should be surprised if Sai Baba’s devotees are so full of love, how could have been Sai Baba be? When you find a successful, talented, brilliant student, you will wonder how great the teacher would be. If there is a good son, then looking at the son people would wonder how great the parents would be. Similarly looking at all of you, if this God has such devotees, how would be that God?
If you want to reach Sai Baba to the world today, taking photograph is not enough. Not even lecturing, speaking. Through your behaviour, through your conduct, through your life, you have to demonstrate Sai Baba to the world. All of you should become Sai Babas. That is My only desire. I don’t have any other desires. You have to fill your hearts with love, use your hands to serve others, speak to everybody with love, and you demonstrate the principle of love and service of Sai Baba to everybody. 
At this moment, all of you should resolve within your hearts, “This body is not mine, the body belongs to Sai Baba; these hands are not mine, hands belong to Sai Baba; these eyes are not mine, these eyes belong to Sai Baba; my life belongs to Sai Baba. Only when you do that, what I aspire can be achieved. 
At this very auspicious and sacred juncture, we have to achieve things with great determination. And if you do that, that is the guru dakshina. People keep calling me Sadguru, Sadguru. But you have to offer the dakshina to the Guru also. I don’t stretch My hand only for taking. I always stretch My hand for giving. But I stretch My hands only to receive love. If you give Me your love, that is enough for Me. All of you develop selfless love, involve yourselves in selfless service, and demonstrate the principle of Sai Baba as love and service.
Now that all the functions here are over, you are returning to your places. You are going from here with a very sacred and pure mind. You have filled your hearts with divine love and going from here. But never ever lose this purity and love. You take me with you wherever you go. I will be behind you. All the time I will be with you, around you, in front of you, behind you, by your side, inside you, outside you. Only if you develop love, Sai Baba will come behind you; you need not come behind Sai Baba.
What we have spoken is enough. You have to act and show.
I am only speaking in order to express My infinite gratitude. Our students - a lot of them, devotees, as soon as I called they gave up all their work and came and obeyed My command and worked very hard. All the volunteers – Yuva Vrinda and Seva Vrinda members – if they come to Mandir on Sunday morning, I will talk to them and bless them. That is all I can do. You have been doing so much for Me. But what I can do is only just call you, talk to you and give you a meal. Because whatever I do, I do with love, it is very precious and invaluable. All of you come; I will be able to speak with you.
My blessings and Grace are there for every one of you in abundant quantities and make good use of this Grace and Blessings and find fulfilment in your lives.",10/23/2015,Special_Occasion,Navaratri
22,Ati Rudra Maha Yagnam Volunteers Discourse 2,"There are only two words which summarise the essence of all the eighteen Purananas as narrated by Vyasaa. “Punya” (merit) which is to help others and the other is “Papaa” (sin) which means to harm others. 
Embodiments of love, devotees, students, boys and girls!  If you ask the question – why do we perform any action? The answer we get to this question is - we are doing it in quest of happiness or joy. It is the natural instinct of every human being to invite those things that give us joy and bliss and also to get away from those things that causes us pain and hurt. The root cause of this instinct is that the basic nature of human beings is bliss.  Without that kind of joy man cannot live even for a moment. 
The property of fire it to create warmth. The quality of water is coolness. The quality of the sun is to shine and give light. Similarly man’s real nature is bliss. As long as you do not find bliss you will find yourself involved in all sorts of activities, being subjected to all sorts of difficulties and sorrows. Where is this bliss hidden? Is it present in sensual objects? Is it in the objects of comfort and luxury? Not at all! If these objects gave real joy why is that we are not really joyful even after attaining these objects? This world is temporary and full of sorrows. In a place that is temporary and full of misery to get eternal happiness is impossible. It can be obtained only where it is available. You may look for it here and there but you definitely will not find it there. That is why I say that man’s real nature is bliss. But bliss is inside not outside. Whatever is available inside, we have to look for it inside only. You cannot find it anywhere outside of yourself. Therefore in order to look for bliss we need to put in some effort. Even when we want water we drill a bore well. But where is the water? It is inside the earth. Therefore if you want to get water out of the earth we need to put in a lot of effort. You have to drill a borewell, install a pump, a motor and a pipeline, pump the water out and only then will you get water. Water is not coming from anywhere else, it is coming from inside the earth form where we are taking it out and enjoying it. Therefore in order to find bliss which lies within ourselves, sadhana or some kind of spiritual effort is required. 
What is this spiritual effort? There are different kinds of spiritual practices like penance, study of scriptures, going on pilgrimages and things like that. But the best spiritual practice required to crossover the ocean of samsaraa is service. Sometimes the municipality people keep supplying water and once they switch off you will not get any water. If you are dependent on our own well you can get the required quantity of water at any point of time. If we depend on the world for happiness, it is not permanent, it comes and goes. But if we find happiness within ourselves, that happiness is permanently available to us whenever we want. To get water in the bowls of earth we need to drill a borewell. Similarly, to get happiness which lies within us also we need to go within, but it is at a great depth within yourselves. When water is available in the depths of the earth, above this water there are many layers of earth, stone and other things. Only when we pierce through layers of earth and stone you get to water. Similarly the three qualities of ‘Satwa’, ‘Rajas’ and ‘Tamas’ are like the layers of stone and earth that cover the water. Tamas is our ignorance and laziness. It is inertness. The stones and rocks are like tamas. They are stationary all the time and do not move from one place to another.  Therefore tamas – or the quality of inertial is an obstacle for any work. Tamas can be conquered through rajas. Even when a piece of stone or a rock is continuously hit with water it becomes mud and finally melts away, therefore we have to break and eliminate the quality of tamas which is like a rock with the jet of water (rajas) and finally get rid of it. But rajas is not the right quality to remain with us. Rajas is the capacity to do work. But even rajas has to be utilized it in the right way. Ravana had a lot of rajasik power but he used it in the wrong way and ruined himself. Rama also had great rajasik power which he utilized to establish dharma and protect good people. With rajas we can become great but not good. In order to become good – satwik qualities are very essential. 
Can anybody else translate? I will speak in English. The dust that is flying around because of the roads being laid is causing infection to everybody.
But what can we do, no pain no gain! If you want to gain something you have to undergo some pain. If you expect everything to come to us in an easy way then you will only become lazy. Easy means lazy. Some effort – rajas is important to gain over tamas, however rajas needs to be controlled. If there is too much of water in the river it will lead to a flood. If there is less water in the river it is of no use as it will not flow, therefore there are dams built to control the flow of water so that water is constructive and not destructive. Likewise satwa guna or the ability to have control over one’s mind is important to control one’s energies. Energies that are used in the right way, in the dharmik way alone can lead to salvation. However in today’s youth you see tremendous amount of energy, this energy is not being utilized properly. Suddenly there is a flood on one particular day and they are found all over the place doing something or the other and suddenly there is a draught and nobody is seen for the next few days. That is not the way energy should be utilized. It should be constantly channeled through the power of satwa. Satwa, or the divine. Selfless qualities should control the energy and abilities of a person in order to destroy laziness and inertia, help people break out of inertia and transform their animal qualities into human qualities and thereby transform themselves from human to divine. All tamas is animal quality, animals only want to eat and sleep. They do not want to do anything else, whereas human beings want to do many things. They want to travel around the world, go to the moon and mars and all the places in the universe. This is all their rajas. However, satwa will tell you that there is no point in going so far outside, go within. Going to the moon is not so important, going within one’s own heart is more important. All the activities that we do are only for the sake of attaining divine bliss. Physical bliss will last only as long as the body lasts. Mental bliss will lasts only as long as the mind is at peace, however spiritual bliss remains forever. It is the fountain of and source of all joy. 
Para upakara – you are all writing on your scarf. Do you all know the meaning of Para upakara? You think it means to help someone else. No no that is not the real meaning ‘Para’ means that which is beyond – divine, ‘upa’ means near, ‘kara’ means to make you. The one that makes you nearer to your own divinity is ‘paraupakara’. For that sake, this body has been given. So that using this body we can become closer to our divine nature. Body is jada – tamas. Mind is rajas and the atma tatwam is satwa. We must break the layers of tamas, drill through the layers of rocks and go down deep into our atmic nature. From there we can derive divine bliss - the source of water that remains forever with you. 
All these opportunities are created not because there is something to be done for Swami or because something needs to be done for others. It is only created for the sake of your divine progress, progress to your own divinity. Therefore never ever think that you are doing anything for anybody else’s sake it is a great mistake to think like that. Always think that you are doing it for yourself. You are not different from the other. It is the same atma which is residing in all people. Therefore whomever you feed, you feed yourself, whomever you greet you greet yourself, whomever you malign or insult - that is also to yourself. There is no difference. 
I did not call you all here to listen to words of gratitude from all of you. I called you all here so that I can express my gratitude to all of you. Many people say – “Swami thank you for giving the opportunity”, but I must tell you thank you for taking the opportunity and using the opportunity. I give opportunities but not always everybody is able to take it. The one who takes it and uses it will redeem himself or herself. It is not for the sake of others, you all have always prayed to be close to me, to be of service to me, to be able to use all your abilities, energies all your life in my service. As and when time comes I am going to draw you nearer and nearer to Me and I am going to fill your hands, head and heart with only My thoughts, My words and My actions and nothing else will exist other than Me. You and I will become one. 
The readiness that you come in with, I can give you only that much. For a first standard student you cannot teach fifth standard syllabus. You have to teach second standard, then third, like that the boy or girl needs to gradually learn and grow. All of you are like travelers, like passengers, you are coming closer to Me. Every single act of selflessness takes you a step nearer to Me. The moment you take one step I take hundred steps nearer to you. One act of selfishness takes you one step behind. Therefore it only distances you from Me. Every single act will take you closer to divinity which is what your true nature is. 
The other day I mentioned what is the purpose of what we are doing, it is to become like Swami. You should have only one prayer - “Swami make me like You. Make me You, not even like You. Make me You. Because you and I are same. I am not able to know that because of layers and layers of ‘agyana’ (the soot that is covering this bright flame that is glowing within). Clean me of all this tamas. Let divine qualities manifest. Let the light of my wisdom and love give light to others as well and light up their paths too”. 
The lamp that is lit at the door step, brightens the space outside the house as well as inside the house. Similarly chanting the name of the Lord on your tongue will give joy to others who hear it and as well as to you – the one who says it. Name of the Lord on the lips and work of the Lord in the hands. This is all that we have to pray and yearn for. The more you do for me the more you become like me. All these are just opportunities for you to get back to your own divine nature. Never fool yourself with the thought that you are doing anything for anybody’s sake, or even Swami’s sake, Swami is not somewhere - He is right inside you. He is you, you are Him. So you are doing it for your own sake. 
Did you all enjoy? There is no greater joy; the closest to divine joy is the joy of service. There is no joy that comes anywhere near that. Even if you remember this day or these days after ten years it will again refill you with the same joy, same bliss. It will not fade, it will not become stale. It will always remain fresh. Today you eat food you enjoy, can you eat the same food again and derive joy? You cannot because the food has gone stale and it cannot be used. But every time you remember these days you will derive joy. Every time you serve you will become more joyful. 
Things are only going to grow. You have no idea about what you have undertaken. Yesterday at fifteen minutes past noon the kala changed, from one kala to another. I was trying to make the Poorna Ahuthi happen at around that time. But it does not really matter as long as I was there blessing it. The next cycle of time has begun. It is the right time to do all kinds of sadhana. 
A day is divided into three parts of eight hours each. Morning 4 to morning 8 is satwa that is satwik time. Again evening 4 to evening 8 is satwik time. During the satwik time if you undertake satwik or spiritual activities you will benefit the most. Certain crops grow in certain seasons, if you grown them in those seasons they will grow the best. Likewise doing spiritual activities during satwik times will yield the best results. Morning 8 to evening 4 is rajasik time you must engage in actions using your body and mind. If you don’t do that and sleep through that time you will not be able to achieve success. Night 8 to morning 4 is tamasik time. That is the time when you must sleep or rest. Therefore depending upon the time and situation one must act. This is a rajasik time. Kali yuga is over and Satya yuga is coming now. It is a time of rajas but that should be controlled by satwa. Earlier, rajas was under the influence of tamas, now rajas should be under the influence of satwa. We cannot escape actions because the world is defined by actions. Therefore engaging in positive actions, pure actions which are guided and influenced by divine qualities within you will help you utilize this new age and new time appropriately. 
Is there anything you want to ask Swami? How do you know you have really served well? People who have attended the yagyam are definitely an indication, but how can you measure their happiness, there is no way you can measure their happiness. Is it half kg happiness or one kg happiness? Self-satisfaction - the more you are satisfied with yourself that is the proof of your own service. You should be satisfied. Your heart should tell you that you are satisfied with the way you served. It should make you more and more humble, peaceful and equanimous. These are the results of service. If service is only leading to ego, if service is leading to loss of peace and restlessness, if service is not causing satisfaction within then there is no service, something is going wrong in this service. In service there is no ‘I’. ‘I’ is the root cause for everything. You should not work for anybody else’s satisfaction but for your own satisfaction. Whether you are happy, you are satisfied, your own atma needs to be your witness. No body needs to praise you, pat you or give you any certificates, or tell you how well you have served. You should certify yourself. If you are satisfied and your heart is happy then it is the measure of your quality of service. If you are not happy at the end of it then the service has not really been effective. As I said all service should take you closer to your divine nature. 
What is divine nature? Divine nature is peace. Divine nature is humility. Divine nature is love. If you are developing these qualities through service then you are going closer to your divine nature. For some people water will come by drilling a little, for some people you have to really drill deep to get water. Do not stop unless you have got water because that is the purpose for which you have begun drilling in the first place. 
As I told the other day I do not have hands, legs, eyes or a body. All your bodies are my bodies. Therefore through all of you only I can act. This universe which is goverened by this law because it is sthoola or gross it needs a gross body to do any action. Even to move this chair from one place to another a body is required to do it. Chair is gross so a gross body alone can move it. It will not work on its own. Likewise to do seva for people in this world I need a physical body and because I do not have one I need to use all of your bodies. Just be available for me. If you are available to do, I will do everything through you. 
Many of you have not slept and taken any rest, have not eaten on time, have not found the time to enquire about the welfare of your own family members. But when I say that I express my gratitude, I don’t just express it to you who are seated here, I also convey this to all those who allowed you to be here and do this service. Your husbands, your wives, your children and family members, office people – to everybody my blessings and gratitude is to be conveyed. For somebody, has taken your responsibility and allowed you to do things here. They are also equally part of this seva. 
You have only seen how things have happened in the physical world, how things have got organized, but there is so much more that has happened in the world that is beyond our physical vision to make this yagya happen. You will not have an idea of what you have undertaken now but after few years you will realize what has happened and what the impact of what has happened was. Every year we will have a yagya, once in five years we will have Athi Rudra Yagya, other years we will have Maha Rudra Yagyas to commemorate this auspicious time. With the opening of the new prayer hall which is on the eighteenth the Hiranyagarbha lingam will find its place, it will be installed there. Daily abhisheka will be performed. 
Over a period of time, you will see people will keep increasing here. Therefore you have more responsibility as time comes. If you share the responsibility, all will get an opportunity and nobody will feel the burden. Therefore organize yourselves in very clear teams not only to come once in a while for the yagya or such activities but also to come on a regular basis, to run the ashram and to look after the welfare of the devotees. These people are running hostels and schools, they only know that and that is their responsibility I have given them which they have to fulfill. But running the ashram and looking after devotees is the responsibility of my devotees my youth and my alumni. They should come together and take up this responsibility. Let them manage the hostels and the institutions which is their duty. If we all do our duty properly everybody will be happy. More accommodation is coming up we are continuously trying to improve the facilities, it will take a little time. But in a short time everything will be in place. 
What else can I do for you? I can only convey my blessings I have nothing to give other than myself. Take me with you wherever you go. Let me be with you. When are you going to come again? Come soon come soon. 90th birthday is the first birthday in this new age and is one of the most significant events in this whole cosmos and therefore this opportunity to celebrate is given to you not to anyone else. Make best use of the opportunity. Now itself Narasimhamurthy is falling sick under the pressure of an Athi Rudra Yagyam, birthday is like ten Athi Rudra Yagyams together. Lot of work is there. But I will be standing behind. I will protect, I will help, you just do your duty. “Maam dhayanti yudhyascha”. Think of me and fight the battle. That is do your duty. “Neemitha matram bhavya sacchi”. Be an instrument O Arjuna! That is all that I expect from you. I will do everything through you. 
I am very very happy. I wanted to talk to you all and convey my happiness. My happiness is not mine but it is the collective happiness of all the people who have come. I am continuously getting messages from all around the world that how happy they are for having been given the opportunity to witness this event. I am continuously getting messages from all around the world. So you have given joy to so many people. In that joy you have found your joy. Very happy!	",10/25/2015,Service,
23,Evening Satsang,"Oh brave son of Bharat listen to this, What is it that you get when you are born, and what is it that you take when you die and leave this world. What is the money or wealth that goes with you when you leave this world.
Embodiments of divine love, when we were born we came with empty hands, even a piece of cloth was not there on our body when we were born. Not only that, when we leave this world that is the way we leave this world. There is nothing we get into this world and there is nothing we can take from this world. But what is important is what we leave behind in this world when we leave the world. In the human lives we find many people putting in all kinds of efforts in getting subjected to all kinds of miseries, in search of wealth, in search of treasure, in search of name, fame, position and authority. But finally nothing remains with us. Only that which we have done for others remains. 
Where does it remain? It remains in each ones heart as love, as compassion and as nobility. Many kings, emperors have come and fought many battles, extended their kingdoms and they have lost today. Today nobody remembers them. May be they are all a part history textbooks which we have to study but nobody really relishes and cherishes them. Even today we remember, talk about, cherish the stories of people who are great devotees of God, men of sacrifice, who helped others and those people who served the society. In this life it is absolutely temporary, what remains is truth and good name. But there are a lot of people, whatever they do, they do for their own sake and whatever they get through these efforts only they want to enjoy. Such people don’t get a feeling that we have to do something for others and leave behind. 
One day one grandfather was sowing a seed in his garden, there came the grandson. Like any small child he went on asking questions to his grandfather. What are you doing? Why are you doing and what is the use of this doing? He said, “ I am planting the seed of a mango tree so that we grow one mango tree in our garden.” Young boy asked him, “how many years does it take for the mango tree to yield the fruits?” Grandfather said that it will take atleast 5 years. The boy asked him how do you know that you will be there for another five years and that you will eat the fruits of this mango tree. Then grandfather said, I am not sure whether I will live for another five years, after all everything can be taken away from a man in a moment. I am not sure whether I will be living next year then how will I think that I will be there after five years. The boy asked him, why are you toiling so hard in the sun that you are trying to plant a mango tree here? He said, I am not doing this for my sake. Grandfather said that I have only one desire that when this mango tree grows up and yields fruits. You will eat the sweet fruits there. Then you will think of me and remember me. That’s why I am doing it. Then with great respect you will talk about me that this tree was planted by my grandfather. Whether I live or not, whether I eat it or not, if you live long and eat this fruit, that’s good enough for me. Look, in our garden there are so many trees and they are giving us good shadow and also lots of fruits. All these trees were not planted by me. My father and grandfather, they planted these trees and that’s what we are enjoying today. Therefore, similarly the seeds that we plant, they grow up and help our children and our grandchildren. And this is what we need to do, we have do our work and help others always. Name and fame finally merge in the soil, but only truth and good reputation will remain for one. Therefore, that is what we should acquire good name and truth. When we do good work nobody forgets  us and even when we do evil deeds, people don’t forget us. You should always aspire that people remember us for our good deeds. 
What is a good deed? Good deed is an action that we involve in for helping others, for helping everybody. And it is Punya or merit to help others. When we help others, those people who are helped will also help others. And that is how this help keeps on growing.
Eshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a very good personality. He established an educational institution in Calcutta and admitted a lot of poor children and helped them. And there was one boy who was struggling to pay the fees. Because the fee was not paid by the student, the Prinicipal took off his name from the rolls. That boy was sitting outside the school and was crying. And Eshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was walking that way. He saw that boy and questioned him, why are you crying? He said, “ I could not pay the school fees. We are very poor people. We can’t pay the school fees. My name has been  struck off from the register. That’s why I am crying.” Then, Eshwara Chandra Vidya Sagar told him, “Don’t worry. You come to the school tomorrow. I will look after your fees.” And he himself paid the fees and saw to it that the child continues education the next day. This boy was very joyful. He came running to Eshwara Vidya Sagar . Sir, “You have helped me so much; please tell me how I can help you in any way. Then Eshwara Chandra Vidya Sagar told that boy, “Dear boy, I lost my father very early in my life. I was always struggling to pay the school fees. My name was also struck off from the rolls because I did not pay the fees. And I was crying sitting outside, when one of the teachers came and consoled me. He also paid my fees and in a similar way, I went and asked him, “you have paid my fees and you have done so much help to me; what is it that I can do for you.” Eshwara Chandra Vidya Sagar replied, “You need not do anything for me, what you need to do is when somebody else is grieving like you because he is not able to pay the fees, you have to pay the fees. Service done to me by the teacher, today I am repaying by paying your fees. Today you are in debt, when you are able to earn the money and you pay the fees of some other child like yourself, you will be repaying that debt. I don’t desire anything for myself, I have everything that god has given me now. And tomorrow when we grow up, you help somebody like this, then I will be happy.”
If you light the lamp of love in your hearts, through that lamp, you can light many other lamps. You can light many lights of love everywhere and see that the whole world is full of light. This body is the lamp. The oil is love in our hearts, wick is the mind, the lamp of wisdom can be lit and we can light many other lamps of wisdom. 
People keep praying Asatoma Sadgamaya – lead us from untruth to truth, we also pray that lead me from darkness to light, from death to immortality. What is this untruth and what is this darkness? The selfishness and self interest : they are Asath and these are the feelings that arise out of body consciousness. When we develop narrow mindedness of I and mine, then we will be subjected to that darkness, untruth and death. But when we light the lamp of love in our hearts, love others, help others. We will be led to the light of immortality. 
Many of you would have gone to Raipur and would have seen the hospital. I also went there to attend a conference. There was a chief surgeon who spoke, who told us a very sacred story at the conference. 
There was a great heart surgeon in Madurai who was very famous and was only 35 years old. He had his wife and children in Chennai. He was the first person to do the heart transplantation in India. He saved the life of a child by transplanting a heart. The child would have died if the transplant was not done.  He took great risk, prayed to god and did the surgery. Because of this prayers and god’s grace, the child became well after the surgery. Because of his great faith, without any fear he undertook that surgery with great risk. But then something dangerous happened. Once it happened that in a bad accident the surgeon himself fell down from the third floor and lost his life. All of you know that in a heart transplant within a minute or so the heart should be removed from the person who is dead and should be transplanted. The surgeon’s friends called up his wife in Chennai and told her about the accident and that her husband had died. “My husband always wanted to help heart patients. Today, if anybody else needs his heart you can take the heart and transplant it to somebody’s body. This is the respect and honour I want to offer to my husband. All his life he spent helping children and saving lives by doing heart surgeries and heart transplants”. The wife said, “Don’t worry about me, I do know that within four minutes the heart has to be taken out. Take this heart out and help somebody who needs that heart.” Because of her nobility and magnanimity, the heart of her husband was transplanted in the body of a young man from Maharashtra and his life was saved. In such a tragic situation, any wife would have lost her heart and would have been lamenting and felt miserable. But here was a lady who thought of helping others through the heart of her husband. Even today the wife is happy, “Even though my husband is gone, his heart is beating is beating in somebody’s body and helping somebody, that makes me feel very happy. My husband also wanted to help everybody ailing with heart diseases therefore, what I have done is a great honour for him. I did not do any mistake in giving away his heart to somebody else.” That lady used such great discrimination even during such a tragic situation. Such people remain immortal in this world. 
The body has come and one day or the other it has to leave. When you purchase anything in the market there is manufacturing date and expiry date also. Birth and death are always working together. Even after the death if people have to remember you, they will remember because of your service, sacrifice and good work that you do. Therefore, you have to live with a sense of sacrifice all the time. 
Not by activity, not by money, not by progeny we get immortality. We get immortality only by sacrifice. What is this immortality? – Amruthatwam. One who does not die, one who remains forever is immortal. Body will have to go, it is inevitable but your actions will remain in the world. Narayan Bhat who established this institution. He offered all his properties and wealth for this cause and worked very hard for bringing up these institutions. Because of the great sacrifice he did, so many children today are getting education. Because of the great inspiration provided by him of great sacrifice, there are also many others who are taking the path of sacrifice and making their life very sacred. 
Every tree will grow up in one place and die in the same place. But the fruits that you find in that tree the seeds will be sown in many places and that tree will continue to live in many other places. That becomes amruthatwam and that becomes immortal. That particular tree has to collapse and fall down one day and what is immortality. The seed out of that tree being planted somewhere else and again coming as another tree that is immortality.
When you light a lamp, sometime or other the lamp has to go out. Through that lamp when you light the other lamps. The lamps will continue to grow. Therefore, light has no death and that is what we say lead us from darkness to light and death to immortality and untruth to truth. This is truth, this is immortality, this is light. Only through sacrifice we remain immortal. All the other things as per the rules and regulations of the universe, they come and go. Therefore, all of you have to develop that kind of selfless love and sacrifice and serve and attain that kind of immortality. That is immortality. The joy that you derive out of sacrifice that is immortality. 
Today one person told me that I don’t know how divine joy feels like, atleast once if I experience it then I will try to experience it again and again. But I don’t know the experience of that divine joy. Without getting into the water if you want to learn swimming is it possible? And if you tell the teacher first you teach me swimming then I will get into the water, that is not possible. In the same way as we teach a child, show them a rock and tell them that a mountain is a thousand times bigger than this. First you have to make little sacrifices and enjoy the joy that you derive out of such little sacrifices and imagine that how great that joy will be. Then we can think that with a little sacrifice we attain some joy and divine joy will be thousand fold more than this. In Anandavalli also it is said, they also talk about the manushyananda – joy of a human, joy of a demigod, joy of an angel and finally goes on to talk about divine joy. Therefore, through sacrifice we experience little joy then we can multiply the joy in our heart. At least imagine that divine joy will be a crore fold more than that. When you experience joy in your hearts, I also experience joy. Your joy is my food and all of you keep praying that Swami should be happy and healthy. For a good life, good health is very important. For good health, good food is important. For you, you eat gross food, for me your bliss is my food. When you are all blissful I will be very strong and healthy because bliss is my food. Then when will you attain that bliss? Only through sacrifice you can enjoy that bliss. When you sacrifice and enjoy bliss, that bliss will look after me well as my food. 
Who am I? I am actually divinity within you. Through sacrifice, the joy of sacrifice, you will know your divinity within your heart. It is only through sacrifice that you can attain immortality. All the actions and all the activities are only Karma kanda. They pertain to the world of activity and what we ultimately get is the joy within our heart. Therefore, we get true bliss only in sacrifice. 
And this activity we saw here in the last eleven days was the result of sacrifice of many people through that you have enjoyed lot of bliss and given it to others also. When all of you are blissful, I will also be blissful. Therefore, you do sacrifices and enjoy bliss and offer that bliss to Swami as food. Swami will be strong and blissful. Very Happy!!!
Are all the sevadals going back home today? Swami is very very happy. Don’t think you are going all alone, I am also coming with you. When you keep praying Swami, be with us always, I am surely with you all the time but you should also be with Me all the time. Place your mind always in God, make your hearts full of the light of wisdom and share this light to everybody and give this joy to everybody. Love is my Form.",10/25/2015,Service,
24,Evening Satsang,"The power of Rama is so great! Can you imagine a monkey jumping over the ocean; will Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, offer herself to him and serve his feet; a clever Lakshmana surrendered himself to Rama and laid down his life for Rama; even Bharata who was a great thinker and an intellectual offered himself at the service at the feet of Rama; therefore, Rama’s power is unimaginable, indescribable.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Rama, after having completed his education, came back to king Dasharatha in Ayodhya. He was still a boy not even a young man. Vishwamitra came there and requested Dasharatha, “We have undertaken great sacrifices, yaagas and yajnas; but demons and demonesses have been coming and disturbing and obstructing the yaaga. Dasharatha told Vishwamitra, “You need not have to worry, Sage. I will send all my army and they will be able to kill all the demons and demonesses and protect the smooth conduct of the yajna.” But Vishwamitra had only one prayer. “It is enough if you give me only Rama and Lakshmana. I don’t need your army.” But Dasharatha because of his attachment to the children said, “These are still boys. How can they wage battles against the demons and demonesses? You ask for anybody else, I will send; but not these two boys.” But Vishwamitra told Dasharatha, “Because of your attachment to your children you are speaking thus. But actually you are not following your raja dharma. As a king, your duty is to send whomever I ask for. Dasharatha was convinced and Vishwamitra took Rama and Lakshmana with him. They left Ayodhya, Vishwamitra along with Rama and Lakshmana; and they walked all the way, they went through the forest and finally reached the destined place of the ashram. Where is it? In fact it is Muddenahalli. Those times this was the place where Vishwamitra’s ashram was there. Even Nandigrama was also an ashrama. That is why finally Bharata also stayed in Nandigrama. Therefore the first ashram to be established here belonged to Vishwamitra.
What kind of sacrifice did they perform? Even at that time and even now the yajna that is performed is in praise and adoration of Lord Shiva. And Vishwamitra made Rama install the first Shivalinga there. Later on as time passed many kings came and they changed the profile of the temple where the Shivalinga was installed. Bhartrihari was the first king who built the Shiva temple. First it was a very small temple but with the advent of Cholas, Pandyas and Krishnadevaraya, the temple went on growing. In many thousand years, there were great changes in the temple. First the installation was done by Rama himself. Therefore, this place is a very meritorious, sacred, pure place. Because I knew all this, when I came here first time, I called this the land of penance, ‘Tapobhoomi’. Here there is the divine power which pervades this place. Because of the penance done by many sages and saints, the place has become very sacred.
Wherever there are trees, you see clouds being attracted there. When the clouds come, naturally the trees also grow. Because of the penance of the people here in this place earlier, this place is growing. Everything in history has a background; if you know it you will be able to get more inspiration and sincerity in doing the work. This sacred place is full of many very sacred, subtle beings. You may not be able to see them physically; but they are all here. All the sages and saints have been waiting for Rama to come to this place. Therefore, this place is going to grow very big. From next year onwards you will see many great hermits, yogis, and sanyasis from Himalayas and other places are going to come here. The place will be always full.
And of course he is speaking with great pride that such a big hall is coming up here; but I want to tell you that hall won’t be enough. You will all be there; you are going to see what is happening. It will keep growing. One boy asked me, “Swami, this is not a big place like Puttaparthi. So many people are coming. Will this place be able to take all of them?” I told him, “Always it will be fine. Because I keep giving tests. And only those who pass in the tests will get promotion, others will be demoted. Because of periodic tests only those people who deserve to stay here will stay here; others will have to return. Therefore, this place will be enough all the time.”
“Swami, test is your taste. Suppose we have to pass the test, what is it that we need to do?” For those university students, high school tests are really not very difficult. University students can easily pass the high school tests. Therefore the highest type of education and knowledge is spiritual wisdom. Atma is nothing but selflessness. When you are selfless, you can pass all the tests. Only people without ego and attachment can stay here and do work here. Depending on the quantum of service opportunities we get, we should become more and more humble day by day. Actually what really signifies, indicates your spiritual depth is your humility. The work that we do should be done with much humility. 
When Dharmaraja performed a yajna, he distributed all the work to everybody; Krishna did not get any work. And Krishna is God Himself. Krishna aspired to do some service in the yajna. Then Dharmaraja told him, “Swami, you are the greatest person. You choose what you want to do.” “You distributed all the work to everybody but there is something you have forgotten. That is what I am going to do.” And Dharmaraja was a great manager; all of you know that. Like all of you, what you have done, he formed many committees and all the work was distributed. “And what work is left out?” he asked. “You have assigned all the work except the work of clearing up the place after everyone has dined on the leaves. That work I will do.” “It is a great humiliation, Lord, why do you want to do that? You are the yajnapurusha; I don’t think that I should allow you to do this menial work.” Then Krishna said, “No work is big for me, no work is small for me. All work should be done for purity of the mind. Even the smallest work that we do will help us to progress on the spiritual path.” With great humility, Krishna cleared the plates after people had eaten their food on the leaves.
When God has so much humility, how humble His servants should be? Therefore, as servants, the first quality that we have to develop is humility. Therefore, with whomever you talk to, in whatever situation, always talk to them with humility. Because there is one atma who pervades every being. 
So many of you have got together to do the work; among yourselves there should be harmony and love. And naturally when you form committees, some people will be called leaders. The leader is the first servant. Therefore leaders should become servants. And for a leader to think I have been given the biggest job is not the right thing. You should know that Swami has so much of faith in you that you would do the work with so much of humility; therefore, in that kind of humility you have to perform your work. 
Nothing is impossible. And with My Will and your work we can achieve anything. And you do your work; I will pour Grace on you. And the program that is going to happen – the 90th birthday- it will happen better than all the programs which have happened here earlier. And not only here, anywhere the functions that are performed till now, this is going to be the best. Because people are gathering here with so much of sacred feeling of love and devotion. We are not doing anything for show. It is not exhibition; it is demonstration. With your words, with your talk, with your work you have to set an example for everybody.
 A good number of devotees will come. People from Bangalore, Mysore, those who go to Puttaparthi; evenings all of them will come here. Even lot of foreigners who go to Puttaparthi will come here in the evenings. Therefore, we have to create facilities and give greatest comfort to all devotees who come here especially on the Birthday evening.
You also have to look after your health. Without proper food and drink, many times you get tired. You don’t sleep. Body is like a machine. You need to give some rest to the body. You have to do it in batches. When one batch does the work, they go for rest; the second batch should start. To a great extent you can give lot of work to our students also. They will do as much as is possible for them. It is not any great difficulty for them. They will do it with love. You also give lot of work to the ladies. When they participate, they will get a sense of involvement. They also feel they are doing something for Swami.
Three or four years before, who was here? After Swami came here, number of people is growing. However long the journey, two people walking together, step after step, can reach the destination. You should never doubt so much work Swami is giving us, will we be able to achieve it? Hanuman could cross over the ocean because he had the faith that “Rama has given me the work, he will also give me the strength to do it. I will put in my effort and Rama will look after the rest.” Therefore, even for a moment, don’t have any doubt. 
There are five fingers in the hand, they are different; when the five fingers get together they can do work. When you get together and work with unity, anything can be achieved. Don’t think that you are arranging some Birthday program or any kind of function. This is a kind of sadhana for you. It is for your spiritual emancipation you are doing it. Therefore, all of you will have to work with great faith, sincerity and devotion. 
Today you can have your meetings and discussions but after all our teachers come, then we will get together and discuss again. I called you in order to tell you that I have great Grace and My Blessings are there with you. If I have faith that you are able to do, why should you not have that faith? Therefore, have faith, courage and enthusiasm; Swami has told us and we are going to do it. We need not have to bother what others say. You do what your heart tells you. Follow the truth, follow the righteous way. You have to think that everybody should be good. You should not swerve from the path of Truth, from the path of Dharma, and also from the world welfare point of view. We have to have faith, enthusiasm and courage that we are doing everything for Truth, Righteousness and World welfare. I am there with you and you will be able to achieve anything with Me with you.
Everything will happen well and after the celebrations are all over, we can meet again; but now you complete your discussions today. Again I will call you.",10/31/2015,,
25,Evening Satsang,"That devotee is very dear to me who does not hate anyone; on the other hand, he has love, compassion and friendliness towards everybody; and he is equanimous in sukha and dukha; and he is always content, ever content, he is every happy; and also he is ‘drudanischaya’, he has the single-pointed determination to adore the Lord, love the Lord above everything else; such a devotee is very dear to Me.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Devotion is not just involving ourselves in adoration, worship and singing bhajans or going on pilgrimages and worshipping many Gods and Goddesses. They are only external customs and they are not connected with internal effort to know God. More and more we become extroverts, you go outside in search of things, then you are getting more and more far away from your internal Self. As you walk towards east, you are getting more and more distant from the west. Many times you involve yourselves only in external activities; thereby, we are getting away from our own inner selves. All the kinds of worship, adorations, yaagas and yagnas are good; we have to ask the question why we are doing all this. You are not really doing all that to adore God, to love God, to win His Grace. All this we are doing in order to draw out the inner divinity within ourselves. Divinity is like water which is in the bowels of the earth. If we want to get that water, definitely you can’t escape digging into the earth. And we have to keep going deeper and deeper till we reach the water. But on this water will be many layers of stones, rocks, and also soil. Only when we break through the layers of earth and stone can we reach the water. All spiritual effort is similar to this. In order to get the water which is deep in earth, we pump that water; spiritual effort is to reach that divinity, take it out and experience it in our hearts. The layers of stone and earth which cover divinity within us are the three qualities of tamas, rajas and satva; the spiritual effort is to break through these layers, and reach the divinity and experience it. 
Tamas is a kind of inertia or laziness and ignorance which is within us. If somebody likes to sleep all the time without doing anything, it means that he is tamasik in nature. Where do you get this tamasik quality from? This tamasik quality arises out of the animal quality in us. Desire, anger, greed, pride, infatuation and jealousy are all animal qualities in us. You may think it is a layer of stone covering divinity within us.  You have to conquer tamas through rajas. Rajas is full of activity. When we involve ourselves in activities, our inertia and laziness will go away from us. What kind of activities should we involve in? Not doing some activity. True rajas should help you to involve in actions which are pure, sacred and meritorious. But all the activities that we involve ourselves in because of our rajas, we do them with selfishness and self-interest; therefore, they become a kind of bondage and bind us to this world. But they are not going to grant us any liberation. Which are the satvik actions? Those are the actions which we do in order to get away from tamas and secondly, in order to get closer to divinity. Satvik actions are those which we do with the love for God or love of God. It is not just actions we do for the love of God we should also love others selflessly and help others, that is also satvik action. Therefore, ‘no action’ is equal to ‘tamas’. Selfish action is rajas. Selfless action is satvik. Persons who are lazy, don’t do anything; it is better they involve themselves in some activity. And the better thing is to involve yourself in selfless activities and noble activities. So you have to conquer tamas with rajas and rajas with satva; and then we can find divinity emerging within us. All effort should be put in for getting closer to divinity. When you have devotion, just involving yourself in act of worship is not good enough. What is important is what the feeling behind your act of worship. Are you doing it in order to get the perfect and pure Grace of God or for your own selfishness?
There was a devotee who was highly devoted to Venkataramana Swami and he had great faith in Venkataramana Swami. And you know that the devotees who go to Tirupati, they have to climb many steps and cross seven hills, only then they will have the darshan of Venkataramana Swami. Those days there were no buses or vehicles. You had to walk up the hills. He was a businessman. Business people have a lot of business mind. All the time they think if I give one, I should get back ten. Even with God he was doing business. Finally he was going up the hill; thousand steps were left. He sat down because he was very tired and he thought it would not be possible for him to go up the thousand steps. Those days something like glucose which will energise you was not there. He had some groundnuts; he was eating those nuts and drinking water. He was thinking, “I have spent so much money to come here and suppose I don’t climb the last thousand steps, all money will go waste. How can I climb up these last thousand steps? God, I am coming for your darshan; therefore, you have to help me. If I climb up one step, I will give one anna, one-sixteenth of a rupee. Finally after climbing thousand steps, I will put thousand annas in your hundi.” He was counting and he was going up. He climbed hundred steps. “So hundred steps I myself climbed because of the strength I derived from eating these groundnuts, God has not helped me; I will not give hundred annas. I have purchased groundnuts spending money; with that money I am able to get up these hundred steps. So hundred annas I need not give.” Finally, he climbed five hundred steps. “Now five hundred steps also I only climbed; therefore I need not give five hundred annas to God. Because of good rest I took on the way and also because of eating groundnuts, I go the strength and I walked up these five hundred steps; I need not give God five hundred annas.” Finally, he reached his destination, the temple. “I have myself climbed all the thousand steps; I need not give God anything.”  If you cheat God, will God keep quiet? A boy ate a banana and threw the peel on the road. This gentleman, he slipped on that peel and he fell down. And he came down thousand steps. And thousand annas he had to spend on the bandage and medicines! God is reflection, reaction, resound; if you try to cheat God, He is also going to do the same thing.
All your worship, yaagas, yagnas you perform with selfish interest, God will not like it. He knows everything. He really loves us. He will give you what you need at the right time. Whatever He does, He does it with a reason, not without reason. Therefore, only those people who have complete faith in God can become the devotees of God. Those who don’t have faith, they won’t gain any Grace. If you take a sieve and get water in that sieve, is it possible? Because of the holes in the sieve, all the water in the sieve will go away. If the mind if full of selfishness and self-interest and you do all kinds of worship, yaagas and yajnas, all that is like a sieve and divine Grace cannot come there. Only those who do everything for the sake of God, they will really get devotion to God. Faith is very important. He is my father, He is mother; He is my relative, He is my friend.  I need not ask anything from You because He knows everything. Only for people with such faith they will attain divine Grace.
In the city of Baghdad there was a very rich person. He was always praying to Allah with great devotion. He had only one daughter. He wanted to give his daughter in marriage to a person who had great devotion to God; he may not have money, he may not have name and fame, he may not have wealth. “I want a son-in-law who will worship God with real devotion.” Even his daughter had good tendencies and great devotion to God. The daughter also accepted whatever the father said. Today daughters will go and tell their father whom they want to marry and their father has to accept. In those days, the daughters believed that whatever the father did would be for her good and she would accept everything. He went on a travel looking for such a devotee. He went around all masjids and all choultries but he could not find such a person. He was thinking about it when he saw that even after the namaaz was over in a masjid and everybody went away, there was one person kneeling, praying and crying. And he thought here is a person with great devotion to God. He was praying to Allah, “I don’t have anybody else except you. Whatever you give me, I will eat and live that way.” Therefore, he thought that he should give his daughter in marriage to that devotee. Father told the devotee, “I want to marry off my daughter. If you accept, I will give my daughter in marriage to you.” But that person was a fakir. “I don’t have any wealth, name or fame. You seem to be a very rich person. How can this marriage happen?” “It is my desire because you have the wealth of devotion to God that I want to marry my daughter to you.” After some time, arrangements were made for the marriage. Generally Muslim marriages happen in a small way. And he made all the arrangements and the marriage happened. This daughter was also highly devoted; she gave up the mansion of her father and followed the husband into a hut and lived a very simple life. They were spending all their time thinking of God, praying to God, doing namaaz. When they were cleaning up their house, in the corner of the hut they found some piece of bread. She asked him, “Who kept this piece of bread here?” The fakir replied, “Many times even if we beg we don’t get food; therefore, I kept apart this piece for tomorrow. Therefore, thinking that we may not get food tomorrow, I kept it for tomorrow.” The wife was very angry. “My father gave me in marriage to you thinking that you had great faith in God. But you don’t seem to have any faith in God. You don’t have the faith that God who gives us food today, tomorrow also give, and you are saving some food for tomorrow. And I can’t stay with a person like you.” And she went away. In their community, it is an easy way of marriage and easy way of divorcing. “I don’t want to stay with somebody who doesn’t have faith in God; I will stay with only those who have good faith in God.”
For people with faith, whatever they get today, they will be contented. They don’t have any fear of tomorrow whether they would get food or not. Live in present! Present is omnipresent; past is past; future is unknown. Live in present! If you want to live in the present, first and foremost, you should develop faith. When you have faith, you don’t have scope for any kind of fear. You will be always contented. They don’t accept anything from anybody or save anything for the next day. They will always be happy and contented. They will not have any kind of ego or attachment. They will accept happiness or sorrow equally. They don’t hate anybody, they are not jealous of anybody. All the time they will be loving and kind; they won’t hate anybody. They live their life with complete faith that God would look after them. They offer their mind, intelligence, subconscious mind and ego to God; and lead their life with compete faith in God. Only such devotees are true devotees.
If you think “I have done so many number of poojas, yaagas and yajnas, I have gone on so many pilgrimages”, all that you have done it for yourself and not for My sake. If you don’t develop faith and get rid of all kinds of fear, that is all useless. Where do you get fear from? Because you don’t have faith, you get fear. Where there is faith, there is no fear. Where there is fear, there is no faith. When you have true devotion to God, you should also have faith. Only when you have that kind of faith, you will get that kind of love. Where there is faith, there is love. Where there is love, there is peace. Where there is peace, there is truth. Where there is truth, there is God. Where there is God, there is bliss.
If you want to lead a life full of joy and bliss, you have to get rid of the animal qualities in you, develop faith and love for God and involve yourself in activity to help others to please God, only then you can be called a true devotee. Being born in this land of action, you have to involve in activity. There is no place without any activity. There is no moment without any activity. Some activity we may have to involve ourselves in. When you do all the activities for the love of God, all those activities will become yoga. When you are doing work in the office, do it with love for God according to the law of Dharma and offer it to God. “God has given me this family, wife and children. I am doing my work in order to do my duty that God has given me to look after my wife and children and take them towards God. God has given me all this. The wife who is given to me by God, together we should move towards God and we should not develop selfishness and bind ourselves to the family.” It is the duty of the parents to see that the children also develop devotion and selflessness. And if you are a teacher, you have to teach the children devotion to God and see to it that they also become selfless people. And when you do everything for love of God, tamas is transformed into rajas, rajas is transformed into satva. Your life will be full of satva; thereby you will get all joy and bliss. Therefore we should lead such lives of devotion and love and enjoy bliss. Develop faith!
Very happy.
Is it raining?  Now the new hall is getting ready in a very short time. On the last birthday, He saw a lot of people – elders and children – sitting in the cold winter and He just spoke one sentence, “When My devotees are suffering so much, I don’t want to have any programme. Without a roof on their heads, they are all suffering from cold of the winter.” When I said this, immediately Singapore devotees came and prayed to Me, “Swami we will build a hall; You have all your satsangs there. We will see to it that there is no discomfort there.” Many eminent architects and engineers came and planned, and before Birthday we are going to open this hall. 
The hall will be inaugurated on 18th afternoon; all of you can come and participate in the inaugural function. Yesterday when I went there all the engineers told me there is lot of work left. At the same time they said, “Swami, if You bless us, if You shower your Grace on us, we will complete the hall and offer it at Swami’s Feet in time.” Can a monkey cross over the ocean? Can monkeys build a bridge? Will Lakshmi offer herself to him? Would Lakshmana praise him? Would intelligent Bharata prostrate before Rama again and again? The power of Rama is so great. Where there is Rama and Rama’s work happens, there come all good name and renown. All of you can participate in the inaugural function of the hall and enjoy bliss. 
Starting with 18th, there is going to be World Youth Meet till 23rd. Many young men and women are coming from all countries. Many renowned scholars will come and give their talks and also renowned musicians will come and perform. Cultural programmes will be performed by people from all countries. And not only that, people coming from other countries will instruct us in their culture. You have to put to good use the opportunity being given to you by Swami. ",11/1/2015,,
26,Evening Satsang,"When you churn milk, you will get butter. When you churn water, you may also get fire but the value of meaningless talk is zero; this is the truth which I want to inform you today. 
Embodiments of Divine Love!
We adore God as the very embodiment of Time and also the one who transcends time. But we have to ask ourselves a question whether our behaviour is in conformity with the time. Are we utilising the sacred life given to us by God in the right way? Are we utilising every moment given to us to put it to good use? Not at all! From birth to death all the time we are involved in activities to fulfil our selfish desires and self-interest; you will never put the time to good use by thinking and contemplating on God. Only that time when we think of God and contemplate on God, is the time when we are making the good use of the time given to us. All other time is a complete waste.
One youth one day came to Swami and asked Him, “Swami, in your college all your students are all the time spending time in doing bhajans and wasting their time.” He also said, “At their precious age they have to use the time for studies and not waste time singing of God.” I told him, “This is not waste, this is the ultimate goal of life. If you don’t do it now, you will be wasting all your life.”  When you are children, you waste your time on play and games; when you are a young man, you waste your time on worldly pleasures; when you are an old man, you waste your time worrying; nobody is interested and thinking of God. All childhood is lost in games and sports; when you grow up, all the time you are struggling all the time to fulfil your sensual desires; when you get old because of the wrong way of life, your body would be full of diseases, all the time you will be worrying and crying over it. But you won’t get an opportunity to think of God.
Start early, drive slowly, reach safely. What this means is that even when you are young children, if you start contemplating on God so that when you grow up, it continues with you. The habits that you develop when you are children will stay with you as long as you live on this earth. Habit is something which you can get rid of with great difficulty. H-A-B-I-T: With great difficulty, you remove the first letter ‘H’, what remains is ‘a bit’ of it. Even when you remove the second letter ‘a’, the ‘bit’ remains. With greater difficulty, you remove the third letter ‘b’, ‘it’ still remains. Therefore, it is very difficult to get rid of bad habits. Therefore, even when you are young you have to develop good habits so that the good habits will continue with you all your life. When the tree gets old, if you want to straighten it, it is never possible. When it is a tender plant, you can tie a stick and make it grow straight. If you do not cultivate discipline when the children are young, when you grow up it is never possible.
There was a miser in a place. As a young boy, he went and purchased some sandals. All the time, he was worrying if he uses the sandals, they will be worn out. Therefore, wherever he went, he put the sandals under his arm-pit and took them; he never used them on his feet. He always wanted the sandals should remain new all the time. He got married. He also had four children. He brought all the four boys up well. They involved themselves in the father’s business and helped him also. The final moment of death came to the father. He was always wearing one kurta, one jubba and one dhoti; he never had new clothes. He was always patching up even when they were torn; he never purchased new clothes. Such a miser when he was about to die, his four children came to him. “The body will go; don’t spend any money on the final rites of the body. Even when the body was living, I never spent any money on it; why should you spend on it when it is dead?” The boys said, “See, it is not about you. If we don’t do the last rites of the father, people will blame us. Therefore, we think we have to spend some money and feed at least ten brahmins.” Even with that very weak body, there were lot of arguments between father and sons. He had only desire that the children should save all the money without spending. He did not know why and what for the money should spent.
O brave son of Bharat, listen! When you come into this world, you carry nothing; when you go out also, you don’t carry anything. This money that you earn will never come with you. You don’t know where you are going. You also don’t know why you are saving so much money. It is because of a habit. Therefore, the habits that you cultivate while young will be there till you die.
He died. All the boys were looking for the key of the cupboard where money was kept in order to spend money. They searched everywhere; they did not find the key. Then the wife understood where it could be. The wife thought that he would have kept the key with him only because others would spend the money. And his mouth was very firmly shut. When the mouth was opened, they found the key inside his mouth. Such a miserly person, what kind of salvation will he get! Therefore, the habits that he developed when he was a boy he continued till the death.
Therefore, it is necessary we develop good habits while we are young. For developing good habits, you also need good environment. Good company is also required. Our educational institutions provide very good ambience for children to develop good habits and also provide that kind of environment even for elders to think of good things and do good things. As the children develop selflessness giving up their selfishness and self-interest, when they grow up also they will lead such selfless lives. Every man naturally will have some kind of selfishness. But children have a pure mind. Impure feelings should not get into their pure minds. But they don’t learn only if you teach them. The way you behave, they look at you and learn your behaviour. The children look at the behaviour of the elders and they develop the same behaviour. Therefore only when elders have pure good habits, the children also will learn that behaviour.
That is why I sent all the boys to Raipur. Before they went to Raipur, they did not know how that place was. They would have only heard about it; none of them had seen it. With great enthusiasm all the boys and girls went to Raipur. They also understood the kind of selfless work being done looking at the free surgeries on children which are being done there. For everybody, the treatment is being done free without considering their religion or caste or social status. Srinivas has been telling, “When you do such selfless service, nothing can stop it.” 
Selfless love is a very powerful force. Through love we can achieve anything and everything. Who is a weak person? Weak person is one who does not have love. People with love are strong persons. If you want to have strong characters, you have to develop selfless love. You will be doing your daily chores in your houses; when you get into your job also you will do your work. But lot of people do the jobs they do without putting their hearts and souls into it. They do just because they have to do something. That is duty without love; that is absolutely unsacred. Therefore we should never do any duty without love. When you do your actions without love, it will come into bondage and subject you to misery. One who does the action does not derive any joy; and those who receive that action will also not have any joy. Because of lack of love, it becomes a burden and  bondage. Where there is love, there is no trouble of any kind. Where there is trouble, it means there is no love. Therefore, when we do things with love, we never think it is a trouble. 
The second is duty with love. Do all the actions that you have to do with love. You are only doing it in order to discharge your responsibilities. When parents bring up their children with love, it is duty with love. Grown-up children looking after their own parents is also duty with love. Because of the blood relationship, there is a sense of duty there. Parents have looked after children; children will have to look after their parents; that is a kind of duty. Because of the relationship among them, they will have to do that. Whatever we do, we do it with love, and it becomes duty with love. That is good.
But the noblest is love without duty. Love does not have any responsibility of any duty. There is no differentiation such as “Because they are related to me, I have to do this for them; otherwise I don’t do”. Your blood relatives naturally you have to help; that you have to do, that is your duty. But even with others, you have the atma sambandha, relationship of the atma. Because of this atma sambandha you help others, is becomes love without duty.
What is the relationship between Srinivas and those children in Raipur? What is My relationship with those children? What is the relationship between you and those children? That is the relationship of love and atma. That is the true relationship; all others are bondages. With the desire that our students should learn such selfless love, I sent them to Raipur.
Even the younger children want to go to Raipur. Even sixth and seventh standard children are crying and praying to Me that they should also go to Raipur. But it is not good enough only they go there. During their holidays if the sixth and seventh standard children go to Raipur, the parents will be crying at their homes. Troubling the parents and giving joy to the children is not correct. Then the sixth and seventh standard children, when they grow up and come to ninth and tenth class, not only Raipur, I will send them to Delhi hospital which will be ready by that time. You are going to see two hospitals, not one. Therefore, that you lost the opportunity now, you should enjoy it, not grieve over it. 
Whatever Swami does is for your good. If He does not give something which you ask for, later He is going to give more than what you ask for. Therefore, you need not ask Swami for anything. Swami knows what to give, when to give, how much to give to everyone. It is enough if you come to Swami and tell Him, “Swami, I want only you.”
Dears! The life of a human being is really golden. Getting the human birth is so very difficult and rare. Human birth has three kinds of limits: place, time and circumstances. Therefore, we need to lead our life based on place, time and circumstance. It is such a beautiful and sacred place you are living in for your education. When you go outside, you see all impure and unsacred things; you won’t get the sacred environment. You have got a very sacred place. Time! Here you don’t have any responsibilities and troubles. In kitchen, they cook food and give you food. You need not have to cook for yourself. Bathrooms are always ready and you need not have to wait. Here in this place all the teachers are very dedicated and regular to their classes; nobody misses their classes. We are giving you everything time to time. Because time is God! If you put time to good use, it means the opportunity given by God, you are putting it to good use. We don’t know what would happen at any moment. Therefore such a sacred time in your life you have to use it well. And all the circumstances here are also very good. Elders are leading a very sacred life and setting a good example for you. Devotees come here for God and not for any business. You have such a sacred place to live in and also you have a sacred time of your age at this point of time.
Yesterday when we visited Hyderabad, they are running a very small school. They started with a small shed; now they have built some buildings but on the whole it is a small place. They don’t have playgrounds for them to play. In the small place, they play games. Rooms are also very small, not big. There is nothing called an auditorium hall. Because it is in the middle of the city, the environment is very polluted. But I was very happy to see even in such an atmosphere, children are growing up in a very pure and sacred way. They looked like lotuses coming up in slush.	If in a place where they have nothing, they are growing up so well; what would be the duty of our students who are growing up in such a sacred place? When they are provided such sacred place and environment, they should be more sacred and pure. Therefore, the students should get into good activities, sacred activities and not waste their time.
All of you went to Raipur and came. It is also a very sacred place. People there are serving with selfless love. Very poor people go there. Such poor parents who can’t even provide proper food to their children. When they come there; if father eats, mother does not eat; if mother eats, father cannot eat. Because they were given only one food coupon. Now I told them to give two coupons – both for mother and father. Everybody should be happy there. There is a place called Mathruchhaya, ‘Shadow of the mother’, where the mother lives with the child. Mother also lives with the child in the hospital with the gown of a nurse; we don’t need nurses there. Mothers are also getting trained; no certificate is being given but they are getting trained. And the doctors with great humility enlighten them, how they should look after the children before the surgery and after the surgery. Why we are doing all this for the children? Because of relationship of love and atma sambandha. That is what you have to learn. It is mean and narrow-minded on our part to think “This person belongs to me; the other person does not belong to me.” Everything is one and the same; you should not see differences. You have to develop the broad mind that everyone belongs to us. 
Students, what they have learnt in Raipur they have to contemplate on it and also practise it in their lives. We are going to start the second hospital in Delhi very shortly. Srinivas is struggling for the second hospital. Only hospital is not enough; we need good doctors and also technicians. It is my aspiration that these students after they learn good education and serve in such hospitals. Whether we serve in a school or a hospital or a college, we should do it as love without duty. I have sent all of you to Raipur with the aspiration that all of you will develop this goodness and purity and become divine. The future of this country is based on you. You have the responsibility not only for your family but to the society and the whole nation. Therefore, you have to discharge your duties properly. When you do your duty well, you also get rights. People ask for rights; they don’t do their job well. When you discharge your responsibility, automatically, you will get all your rights. Therefore, all your actions you should do as love without duty.
Next summer we also send the next batch of students to Raipur.
Very happy.",11/5/2015,,
27,Evening Satsang,"There are three qualities which always affect us. One is the tamasic quality of inertia; without conquering tamasic quality, we can never recognise the Divine Principle. Then there is the rajasic quality of passion and activity; if you don’t give it up, you can’t cultivate true devotion to God. But finally, the quality of satva or purity is the quality which leads us to liberation. This is the path of Truth, the word of Sai.
Embodiments of Divine Love, devotees!
The whole world is activated by these three qualities – the tamasic quality, the rajasic quality, the satvik quality. In the Taittiriya Upanishad, it is written how this Creation emerged. From space came wind, from wind came the fire, from the fire came water, and from water came the earth. From the earth came the food and eating that food, the creatures thrived in Creation. This world started with the space and came down to the earth; from there to food; from there to all the creatures in the universe. Because every creature is a part of this Creation, each creature has all these three qualities. The three qualities – tamasic, rajasic, satvik – are there in every creature. But the kind of permutations and combinations of these qualities are different in different people.
 In a stone, you only see tamasic or inertia. The stone has all the five elements in it but because of its inertia - the tamasic quality - it is not able to move from one place to another. It won’t grow, it won’t diminish, and it stays like that – a stone. It is an important hallmark of tamasic quality. There will not be change, there will not be movement, and it will be in one place. In rajasic quality, changes keep taking place. A tree keeps on growing. The animal keeps on moving around. Therefore the creatures which are part of Creation, under the spell of rajas, they keep moving, growing, changing and then diminishing. But the most important is the satvik quality. The satvik is nothing but a quality of complete selflessness, totally devoid of any selfishness.
 In tamas, there is laziness or inertia. Because every person has some kind of tamasic quality in him, that is why we are able to sleep, take rest, when we work very hard we get tired and then sleep. Because of the rajasic quality, we are able to perform all our actions. When we do all our actions with selfishness, with a selfish attitude, we remain rajasic; there is no way we can grow into satvik qualities. But that quality which is pure, perfect and divine is the satvik quality. The body is full of tamas. Mind is full of rajas. But in the heart there emerge the satvik, pure feelings. Depending on this, I keep telling you that you are not one but three. To think that you are the body is untruth. The body belongs to you but you are not the body. The rajasic mind is also yours but you are not the mind. The kind of selfless love that emerges in your heart belongs to you but you are not that also. In fact your real nature transcends all these three qualities. But that quality which is nearest to your true nature is the satvik quality.
In the five sheaths that make up our personality there are these five qualities. In the food sheath, there are the five elements of space, wind, fire, water, and earth. Because of the five elements, there is more of tamasic quality in the human body. But from the quality of inertia, from the gross food sheath when you go to the life principle, you give up the element of the earth. In the life principle there are only four of them –space, wind, fire and water. Therefore there will be rajasic quality in the life principle and less of tamasic quality. Because the life principle joins the body, it activates the body and is responsible for all the activities of the body.
You have a fan. This fan does not rotate. It is just stationary. When the electric power flows through it, it starts working. This electric power is a kind of formless energy; when it gets into the fan, the fan starts working. There is no way the fan can work by itself. Because of the electric power getting into the fan, there is a change. Therefore the fan can be compared to the food sheath. But there are five elements in it but it is only inertia. When you give up the tamas and get into the life principle, there is more of rajasic quality. Life principle can be compared to the electric power which activates the fan. It is only a power, a force; it does not have a form. And wherever the life principle wants to go, it can go. The life principle is the subtle form – it is energy, it is consciousness. Because there is rajasic quality in the life principle, there is lot of change and movement and activity. 
When the life principle gives up water, it becomes the mind principle. The mind is also attributeless, the mind does not have any form, but mind can go wherever it wants to, it does not have bondage of place, time and causation. There are three elements out of the five in that: space, wind and fire. 
When you give up the fire principle, the mind principle gets evolved into intelligence principle. In the vijnanamaya kosha, or the intelligence sheath of our personality, there are only two elements there – space and wind. 
When from the intelligence sheath we remove the wind principle, then it becomes the bliss sheath or the anandamaya kosha. That is why it is said “Sound is god, full of bliss, it moves everywhere.” That space principle is there in everyone. That is what is responsible for satvik quality in us. 
Satvik quality descends into rajas when one more element joins it. When one more element joins it, it becomes finally tamasic. When we ascend giving up one element after the other, we move from tamasic to rajasic, rajasic to satvik quality. Depending on the permutations and combinations of these three qualities, different people behave in different ways. People who have more of tamasic quality are very lazy people. They are full of inertia and laziness; they don’t want to do any kind of work and will be sleeping in a place. When rajasic quality gets into that person, he will start working. Because of the rajasic principle, man utilises all his senses and does all his actions. But rajasic is also a temporary quality. One moment you are very happy, next moment you are angry. Sometimes you will be happy, sometimes you will be very sad. This rajasic quality brings about changes in us. But the changeless quality is the satvik quality; that is the principle of love. Therefore, we have to see that our rajasic quality comes under the control of our satvik quality. And we have to win over the tamasic quality through rajasic quality. Therefore, those people who are lazy first they should get into some kind of activity. Those people who work all the time to fulfil their selfish desires should get into selfless work.
One of the boys came and told me there is going to be a management program. They are also thinking of staging a drama on this theme. When they asked Me, “Swami, what is the theme they should have for the drama?” this is what I told them. There are these three qualities in every person. We are doing all our actions through the body. But body does not have its own power. The body is like a vehicle, mind is the driver. Depending on how the mind drives the body, the body follows it. When there is a very pure and sacred driver, he will take the vehicle in the right path. A bad driver takes the vehicle in wrong ways according to his own whims. Finally the vehicle will meet with an accident and the master will not reach the goal.
For the mind driver, there is the atma master. That is the satvik quality. Only when we understand the atmic principle within us and practise it, then we can reach the goal. The body is under the control of the mind. But mind should work for the atma. We need not follow any dharma; we just follow the atma dharma; that is the highest management. In management there may be many subjects like finance and other things but the important thing is man management. The proper study of mankind is man. When you can manage men properly, that is true management. Man has three principles – body, mind and atma. Only when we understand these three principles properly, then we can understand the human personality.
Therefore when you find out your true nature, then you will be able to teach others. And when there is laziness overcoming us, we have to get into activity and get into rajasic nature. Rajasic quality should not activate selfish and self-centred activity; instead of that it should lead to God centred or atma centred activity. But rajasic quality will make ego and attachment come up in you and take you away from God. 
If everyone practises his or her atma dharma, then everything will be fine. There is only one atma in everyone. Therefore you ask anybody any question, only one answer emerges from everyone. Many students may go to the teacher and ask the same question; he will give the same answer, he is not going to give different answers. Students may be different, but teacher is one. Therefore that teacher will give you same reply for the same question all the time.
 All of us have got together to work in these organisations. Whether it is here or anywhere, we have to get together and work. In some circumstances, when we entertain doubts and questions, it is necessary to find answers to them. Where do you get the answers from? When you ask the mind, it gives different answers. Because the mind is different in different people and different people perceive things in different ways. Because mind is full of ahamkara, ego. But atma does not have any ego. When you ask all your questions to your own atma, the atma gives the same answer in everybody. 
There are lot of people who claim that Swami also talks to me. May be; fine! But the Swami who is in everybody will give the same answer to the same question; He is not going to give different answers. In the same way as the teacher gives the same answer to the different students when the same question is asked, atma being the same in everybody will give the same answer when the same question is asked. But why different people say that Swami has told me different things? That is because they are not really consulting the Swami within them; they are consulting the mind. Because there is lot of noise in the mind; because of the noise of ego and attachment in the mind, we can’t listen to the voice of God. When you give up the ego and attachment and then we take shelter with the heart principle, we will get the right answer. Therefore it is necessary you conquer the tamasic quality and bring the rajasic quality under the hrudaya or the atma and develop the satvik quality. 
When you are lying down, you can’t drink water. And even when you are walking, you can’t drink water. When you stand in one place keeping peace of mind, you drink water, then it is the right thing to do. Only then your thirst will be quenched. Therefore, if you want to understand God, if you have tamasic qualities, it is not possible. That is animal quality. If you have only rajasic quality also, it is not useful. When we develop satvik quality and devotion emerges in our heart, then we can understand the divine principle.
In the word satvik, there is what is called ‘sat’. For knowing that ‘sat’ which is the Truth, satsanga, good company, is very important. And if we are in the good company, we can really understand the true nature. Be Good, Do Good, See Good; this is the way to God. When you get into the company of good people, we can develop good feelings. When you run away from bad company and get into good company, you will become good. That is why I say “Run away from bad company!” If you just walk away it will follow you very quickly. Therefore, you have to run away. Therefore, it is necessary that all of you are there in good company all the time and develop this sat i.e. truth.
Wherever you go, whether it is Whitefield, Chennai or Kodaikanal, be in satsang, good company all the time. People generally don’t come forward to speak good things. If somebody speaks wrong things, people will listen very carefully. Such people can they ever understand Me? What is the use of having that kind of mind? Therefore, in good company we should talk good things. When somebody talks wrong things, you should run away from there. 
There are lot of people who are trying to change others. First you have to change. When you change, others also will change. And when you change your vision, the Creation itself will change. Therefore, you understand your own personality properly, give up tamasic and rajasic qualities and develop satvik qualities, you can see God in every creation. When you listen to good things like this you think you have understood everything but when you go back because you don’t practice, you don’t really understand. Practising is very important. Therefore, when you listen to Me, you contemplate on it, practise it, and understand your own true atmic nature. How do you practice? From tamasic quality you should move into rajasic, and from rajasic to satvik quality. When we evolve from one to the other, it is like promotion from first to the second and then to the third class. You have to work hard for this. 
To think that Sai Baba is somewhere is not correct. Sai Baba is hidden behind these three doors – tamas, rajas and satva are the three doors. When you open these three doors, you can easily find Sai Baba. You have to put in good effort, dears. Just coming and going is of no use; it is like ‘jagat’: come and go, come and go, nothing happens. Even if you come only once, listen and put it into practice, that is much better. Really if you come once and listen properly and practice it, then you need not have to come the second time. Because wherever you go, you will see Me. Again and again you need not go anywhere. Because you don’t understand it, you are coming again and again. You have to put in your effort and cultivate, then you can recognise your true nature. 
I have one desire that everybody should realise themselves and everybody should look like Sai Baba in their behaviour. Many people say “Lot of people come here and go; many of them believe, many of them don’t believe; does it happen according to one’s own will? Is it God’s Will?” Will God keep that kind of sense of difference – these people should become close to Me, other people should go away from Me? And one mother wants all children to be close to them. Mother will not have a sense of difference that this boy should come to me and other boy should go away. All are my children; I want everybody to be close to Me. I have done my sankalpa; you have to do your sankalpa. You have to put in the effort to give up ego and attachment, get God’s Grace and walk on the right path. 
I conclude My discourse aspiring that all of you will understand the kind of qualities in your personalities, give up the tamasic and rajasic qualities, develop satvik quality and lead a good life.",11/8/2015,,
28,Evening Satsang,"What is real sacrifice, thyaaga, and what is yoga? Thyaaga is not giving up hearth and home and family and going to a forest. True thyaaga is giving up selfishness in one’s life, in one’s feelings and true yoga is union with God. That is the truth that I would like to tell all of you this evening. 
Embodiments of Divine Love!
Life in this world is full of many worries all the time. Being born, living is a worry, the family life is a worry, death is a worry; even childhood is a worry, old age is a worry; happiness also ultimately leads to difficulties and worries; living itself is a worry and dying is another worry. O devotees! Understand here is one ‘chinta’ or contemplation that will release you from all worries – that is the contemplation of God. When we contemplate on God, no worries will haunt us. What is the root cause of all the worries of man? It is the selfishness and self-interest in his heart. As long as you have that selfishness in yourself, you cannot cross over these worries. All the worries start from the feeling of ‘I’ and ‘mine’.  But those people who have firm faith in God and love for God, no worries will trouble them. All the time, at all places they are all the time thinking of God and they are not worrying about anything. 
Swami Vivekananda gave up his hearth and home and without entering into family life, he offered himself to God. But it is difficult for everybody to lead a life of a sanyasi like him. And there are different paths for different people. But Swami Vivekananda gave up everything, depended completely on God and went around the whole country teaching the truths of Vedanta. He did not have a single rupee in his pocket. He didn’t have any home or any place where he could live in. All the time he was going around teaching the truths. At that time, one of the devotees gave him a railway ticket; he got into the train and was travelling. In front of him sat a very rich person. He was a big businessman. That businessman told Swami Vivekananda, “At this young age without engaging yourself in hard work, you are roaming as a lazy person. It is a bad example for all young men and young women. At your age, at such a young age it is your duty to work hard, earn money and look after your family. In the garb of a sanyasi going around begging for food is not correct. It was summer; everybody was very thirsty. Those days there were not these water bottles. There were people who had kept cold water in a pot and were selling it in the railway stations. Swami Vivekananda being a sanyasi did not have any money. But the rich man purchased water and drank and quenched his thirst but did not care about Swami Vivekananda. Also he was speaking harsh words and hurt Vivekananda’s heart. In the next railway station, the rich man purchased lunch for himself; he did not care about Swami Vivekananda. But Swami Vivekananda sat there very peacefully without being disturbed by anything. He identified himself with the atma and not with the body; therefore despite the businessman speaking very harsh words, he was not feeling sad at all. The businessman thought that even this Swami will be feeling hungry because it was late. He was eating food but he never shared his food with Swami Vivekananda, “Let me see how he will get his food!” Another railway station came and both of them got down from the train. And Swami Vivekananda sat under a tree and he was meditating on God. The body was really hungry. He never knew from where the food would come to him. He had the faith that he depended on God, God will provide the food. But the arrogant businessman stood there watching how this Swami would get the food. 
Within a few moments there came a person and he was carrying food and a mat to sit upon. And he came straight to Swami Vivekananda. He asked him, “Are you hungry, Swami? I have prepared all this food for you and have brought it here for you.” Vivekananda was very surprised. “I never came to this place and I don’t know anybody in this town; how did this gentleman know me?” When Swami Vivekananda asked him, “How do you know me?” he said with great humility, “I have got a sweetmeats shop. I had a nap after my lunch after all the work. God appeared in my dream. Rama came and said, “You have very happily eaten your food and are sleeping here; the devotee is suffering there with hunger.” Sri Rama said, “I am also experiencing the hunger of Swami Vivekananda. You go to the railway station with the food. He is sitting under a tree; offer it to him there.” When the gentleman asked Sri Rama, “How do I recognise Swami Vivekananda?” in fact, God gave him a vision of Vivekananda sitting under the tree and sent him there. He had brought with him very delicious dishes like poori and sweetmeats and offered him. Then the businessman saw all that was happening. He repented for his follies and prayed to Swami Vivekananda, “You have to forgive me. I spoke very harsh words to you and hurt you. You are enjoying God’s Grace because of your faith and devotion to God. I have seen this happening right in front of my eyes; this is a big testimony for me. You are a great person, please forgive me. I have spoken to you very harshly.” And when he started praising also, there was no change in the state of mind of Swami Vivekananda. He considered blame and praise as same. That kind of people who give up everything and commune with God all the time, they are in Samadhi; everything remains sama. He was always having the equanimous state of mind; if he was ridiculed, he did not feel sad and when he was praised also, he did not gloat. He accepted both with equanimity of mind. He shed tears and sang the praise of Lord Rama “I am a very ordinary, insignificant devotee for you. I am not such a great saint but you have not forgotten me, you are looking after me.” For a person who has faith in God, why should they get worried at all about anything? The reason for worries is that we lack faith. We have to develop faith. Having faith in somebody who can be seen with our physical eyes is not great. When everything is going on well for us, developing faith is nothing great. True faith is that faith when you believe in God even during your adversities and difficulties. At happy times, everybody is a devotee. As long as God keeps on giving what the devotee asks for, God will remain God for the devotee. When God, Sai Baba, does not give the devotee what he asks for, He is no more Sai Baba, He is no more God. This kind of giving and taking is a kind of commerce and business; it is not devotion. Therefore, we should not ask God for anything, worry about anything; we should have the faith that God will give us what is required for us at any point of time.
Narasimhamurthy today spoke of big things. He also said big functions are happening here. And sometime one month back you could have come and seen he was very much worried. Now he is speaking very big; one month back he could not sleep. How could it happen all this? He was worried all the time where would the money come from, when the facilities would get ready, how things would happen? Is he doing what he wanted to do? I have said and I am doing. I gave the word and I will demonstrate it, I will do it. You have to do just your work as instruments; I am the one who does everything. All programmes will happen in a very grand manner and nothing will be lacking here. When Narayana is here, Lakshmi would definitely come. In speeches he talks very big; but when difficulties come! This morning I called all the residents of this place and also those people who are involved in the Birthday organisation and gave them courage. Whatever Sai says is Truth; it has to happen. Anybody may try to obstruct and put in obstacles; it is not going to stop. My Mission will always continue. If you participate in My Mission, your lives will find fulfilment, your lives will be sanctified; if you think that you are helping Me, it is a mistake. I always flow like the river Ganga. I don’t have any sense of difference, I do everything for everybody. Because everyone belongs to Me. 
For the World Youth Meet, people from many countries are coming. When we needed a mansion, a building for their stay, we have a building built that also. How big is that? In the 5 floor building more than 1500 people can stay. I am giving all the facilities required for them. But there was nothing lacking in order to complete the building. It is My desire that all people who come here should enjoy everything, lacking nothing. Whatever they learn here, they should go back to their countries and propagate the same message and share their joy with them. My work will never stop; whatever I wish will happen. When you give up your selfishness and self-interest and participate in these activities completely selflessly you can get rid of all the worries contemplating on God and enjoy that bliss.
If you put lot of milk into a vessel, if a drop of curd is also there in that, the milk will be spoilt. You may think it is only a drop of curd, but it is going to spoil everything. We should not have even an iota of selfishness. We should have completely selfless feelings. Nobody should worry about oneself.
In Baghdad there was a rich person who had a daughter; he was trying to find a bridegroom for his daughter. What kind of a person was he? Though he was a rich man, he wanted a son-in-law who was a great devotee of God whether he was poor or rich. Because he had lot of money that God had given him. He was looking for a son-in-law who would be devoted to God all the time. Even daughter was highly devoted to God like her father. Even this girl was doing the namaaz, prayers and all the rituals required for the worship. She also did not have any desires for wealth; she was also looking for a devotee. And he went to many masjids and many choultries and looked for the right young man. Only one person he could find. And he was a fakir, a poor person. After all the people did their namaaz and went back also, this young man was sitting in the masjid all the time praying to God, shedding tears. And then this rich man went to him. “I admire you and you don’t have anything. But you are so happy thinking of God, praying to God; I want you to be my son-in-law. I will give you anything that you require. The young man said “I am happy, contented in what God has give me; I don’t want anything.” The rich man was very, very happy. And when the rich man told his daughter, daughter also accepted to marry this young man. The young man had only one condition, “Nobody should come between me and Allah; and that condition is fulfilled, that’s good enough for me.” On that condition, the marriage happened. The daughter was also very happy that she got such a great devotee as a husband. She also did not have any desires. The young couple were leading a happy life thinking of God all the time, One day she was sweeping the floor in the hut. There was hidden a piece of bread. She thought who kept this here and there came the husband. She questioned him. “Two of us live in this hut and there is nobody else; who kept this piece of bread here.” And he said,” I have kept this here. I have hidden this food for tomorrow thinking whether I would get food or not.” And wife was so much grieving, she shed tears. The wife said, “I married you because I thought you had great faith in God. But today you are hiding food for next day. God who has given food for us today will He not give us tomorrow? I was so happy that I have married a great devotee of God; today I am feeling very sad. Because you are hiding food for tomorrow, I don’t want you.” She left her home and went away.
For a man who believes in God and depends on Him, he won’t have the worries about tomorrow. That person would think today I am devoting myself to God and praying to Him; that is good enough for me. If you develop that kind of faith, that is true devotion. Nobody knows what would happen tomorrow, you have to use your day today. Don’t waste your time on worries. When you develop faith in God and love for God, all the worries will vanish.
Where there is light, there is no darkness. Where there is faith, where there is devotion, there is no scope for any worries. You are living in the ashram and you should have the kind of behaviour and norms of life. All the time at all places you should be thinking of only God. You should pray to God that is enough. Life will be fulfilled with all nobility and merit.
Blessing you that all of you develop that kind of faith and lead a life devoted to God, I conclude My discourse.",11/12/2015,,
29,Akhanda Bhajans Discourse,"Will all birds and butterflies, just because they have wings, can they become parrots? The worms that crawl on a flower, can they become bees? Even a donkey, just because it has the skin of a tiger around it can it become a tiger? Similarly a man who does not know himself, can he know the ultimate Truth?
Embodiments of Divine Atma!
From birth till death man is immersed in ignorance; he does not know who he is. He is doing all the activities without knowing who he is and what his purpose is. Whoever he looks at he asks one question, “Who are you?” He is asking everyone else the question “Who are you?” He does not ask himself the question “Who am I?” In fact when you know the answer to the question “Who am I?” only then you will know the right answer to the question “Who are you?” It is complete ignorance without knowing oneself one goes on questioning others “Who are you?” Only when a person finds the answer to the question “Who am I?” he will be able to know who others are.
Just because you have the body, thinking that you are the body, behaving as the body all your life is a kind of ignorance. Everybody has the body. Just because we have the bodies to think that we are human beings is not correct. Not at all! When we call ourselves human beings it is necessary that we have the human qualities.
What are the human qualities? You may think just walking on two feet, looking with our eyes, and talking, all these are the human qualities. They are only the activities connected with the body; they cannot be the real human values. The highest, greatest, most sacred of all human values is devotion to God. When we really attain devotion to God, we attain everything else in life. You might study lots of kinds of education, you may earn lots of degrees but if you don’t have devotion to God, the whole life is a waste. The love of man for God is the highest human value. When you don’t have this highest human value, all other values in life have no value. But it is not devotion we are happy with God only when He fulfils our worldly desires and when he does not we hate Him. Devotion is steady love for God in spite of the kind of things that happen in our life. Many people undertake the devotional practices like japa, chanting of the name of God, or meditation, they are thinking of the quantity, there is no quality in that. When you ask them the question “Why are you doing all this?” you understand that they are doing all this because of their selfishness and self-interest and not really out of love for God. They want to get something for God that is why they are doing all that.
Among the four kinds of devotees – the first one who goes to God in order to get relief from suffering; the second one who goes with worldly desires; the third one who goes with spiritual desires; and finally the man of wisdom who goes without any expectation – the last one, the jnani, is the greatest. Loving God for the sake of God is true devotion. There will not be any desires and expectations in that kind of love. When you love God without any expectations in return, that can be called true devotion. 
Praising God, adoring God, and worshipping God with many rituals – you may think they are all devotion, really are not devotion. Devotion emerges not from the mind but from the heart. The heart does not have any expectations. All the time it enjoys in the company of God. Just listening to the uttering of the name of God, the heart derives great joy and bliss from that. When we chant the various names of God, every name is associated with one form. Meditation means there is the conglomeration of both name and form. Wherever there is name, there is the form; wherever there is the form, there is also the name.  There is an inseparable relationship between name and form. With true devotion when you call out the name of the God, He appears with His form; without devotion, however much you may call for Him, He won’t appear. On the cover you write the address all the news you have written in the letter. But if you don’t attach the stamp, the cover will not reach its destination. We are chanting the name of God; we are also doing adoration and praising of God. Without the stamp of true devotion to God, that letter will go to the ‘dead letter office’. Once it goes into the dead letter office, it won’t come back. Whatever you do is a waste. Every name has to be uttered with love attached to it; only then we will get the reward. Only through that kind of devotion we should know our true nature. Only when we recognise the principle of God and behave in a way which befits being a devotee of God then only you can know your own true nature. 
Devotion is not becoming an adept and expert in the scriptures or going on pilgrimages or worshipping many deities. After having done all that, you fill your mind with worldly desires, then devotion has no fulfilment. Only in a heart without any kind of expectations God resides. You should have only one desire and one expectation – that is for God. If I attain God, I will attain everything in life. Only God is the Truth, world is an illusion. Once we attain the Truth, Truth has everything in it. When we praise God, 	chant the name of God, worship Him and adore Him with only desire for God, definitely you will attain Him. We may ask ourselves the question, “We did akhanda bhajan, we do chanting of the Vedic hymns, we also do namasmarana or chanting the name of God, are they useful for us in any way?” You should never have any doubt or question about it. When you utter the name of God, the vibrations of love will spread all over the world and purify the world. Any word uttered with love will grant us great strength.
In a classroom a teacher was telling the students; he was teaching them good things in life, “You always utter the truth but don’t utter the truth in an unpleasant way.” This is what he was teaching his students. And there came the school inspector. “You are telling such good things to these boys; do you think your words will enter their hearts? They are only just words and not anything else substantial. Just because of words you can’t teach lessons to the students. The teacher asked one of the students in the class, “You catch hold of the shirt collar of the inspector and throw him out of the classroom.” As soon as inspector heard it, he was very angry. “Do you have any brains that you are talking so ill of me?” Teacher said, “I just used the words, I really did not do anything. I just uttered the words; I did not catch hold of your collar and throw you out. Just uttering the words you are so angry; if I do it what will happen?”
Every word conveys a feeling and we should understand that feeling properly. Therefore, every word we utter should be used very well. Whenever we utter the name of God, every word should be uttered with great love. That great love is nothing but love without any expectation. There is only one expectation: I want God and I want God’s love and nothing else. Since yesterday all of you have participated in the bhajans. Every name of God you have uttered is a link in a chain. If one link is spoilt, the chain will be broken. Every link should be having equal strength. When we utter every name with love we become very strong. We are adoring God Himself. You can bind God by uttering this name of God. With devotion we can also get God under us.
Devotion is not attaining scholarship in scriptures but loving God and uttering His name with supreme devotion. But today men are behaving in such an ignorant way; we can’t really describe.
One guru, a master, taught his disciples, “When you are doing meditation or worship there may be many obstacles, you should not be deterred by them. Whatever people may come and talk to you and ask you, you should not stop it in the middle. Once you start it, till you reach the end, you should continue steadily. And there came the guru’s birthday. In the same way as all of you are planning Swami’s birthday activities, those disciples also planned the activities for the birthday of the guru. The various disciples wanted to worship him differently. They also planned and organised the birthday function in a village. But there was one disciple who lived with the guru. He said, “When you go out for the celebration of the birthday, I will stay back in the ashram and look after the ashram. It is my desire that I worship your feet. If you give me a photo of yours, I will keep it here and worship that photo.” The teacher gave him a photo. This disciple gathered lot of flowers and he wanted to worship the photo. The master went away for the birthday celebrations. When the teacher came back after the celebrations, he found that the disciple was worshipping the photo. But he had closed the door. He didn’t want to be disturbed during the worship; therefore, he had closed the door. He was uttering the name of the guru inside the room. He was saying guru is Brahma, guru is Vishnu, guru is Maheshwara.  The guru was standing outside; he did not have sandals also. No sandals, no cap on the head; he was suffering in the summer heat. He knocked on the door but the disciple never opened the door. The guru told him, “I have come here. Open the door!” The disciple said, “Whoever it is, I am not going to stop my worship. Because my teacher has told me that when you continue to worship, you should not break up in the middle. The disciple was doing the smarana or the contemplation of the name of the guru; and the guru was doing contemplation on the name of the disciple. He shouted, he pleaded; but the door he did not open. You are worshipping that person; that person has come, and you are not responding to him! Because of ignorance we behave that way. 
Lot of people keep the photograph of Sai Baba and do all kinds of worship. If Sai Baba goes and knocks on the door and tells him, “I am Sai Baba here, they don’t open the door.” They say, “How can Sai Baba come back? He is dead and gone. He is not anywhere outside, He is only in the photograph.” However much Swami knocks on their door, the devotees are not bothered. They are doing pooja to Sai Baba but even when Sai Baba comes, they don’t open the door. Such people don’t have any devotion. They think that just worshipping with rituals is the devotion. Not at all! True devotion is in the heart. Wherever a flower blossoms, the bees will come by themselves without any invitation, similarly when there is God, devotees will also flock around Him. Whichever form He comes, a true devotee will know Him. Whenever the mother comes, she may come in a different costume, but the child will always recognise. There may be different number of cows but the calf will know its mother. A true devotee will understand where God is and how He is. When you have such a pure heart, a heart without any expectations, then you will attain God. “I want only God, I don’t want anything else.” Only when you want God and God alone you will get that kind of devotion. Till then you may call yourself devotees but I don’t accept it. A student sets his own question paper, writes the answer, corrects the answer scripts and says that he has passed the examination. For the student, it is the teacher who has to give the examination. Like a teacher, I also keep some examinations for the devotees. Only those with true devotion will pass this examination. To think that I have been with Sai Baba for so many years; I have this qualification, that deservedness is ignorance. No qualifications will be of any use. Only one qualification of devotion is what is required. I follow those people with devotion; they need not come after Me. When you develop that kind of devotion, God will be behind you. Therefore, with that kind of love, you have to develop that steady devotion. Giving and taking is a kind of business and not devotion. 
Give love, Get love! That is what we have to do. When you utter the name of God, we should also visualise the form and develop love for that form, then only you will get the right results. When you utter the name of God in the right way with love, only then you can enjoy the bliss of that chanting. Without feeling, whatever you do it is all a waste of effort. There is no meaning in that effort. You may sing bhajans, you may do many kinds of worship – they will all be useless. Only once you utter the name with love, God will immediately respond. Only when you have the feeling of love, uttering the name will have some value. Only when man has devotion, he has some value. Otherwise it is all a waste. Therefore you have to develop that kind of steady and sacred devotion. We should not have any expectations from God, then only we will get that kind of devotion. God knows everything. Whatever we require – where, when and how much – He knows it and He will give it. If God has not given us something, it means that we don’t need it. Worshipping God in order to fulfil our desires is not correct. We should know that if we have true faith He will give us whatever we require at any point of time. A true devotee will not have any expectations. He will be a man without any expectations. 
I conclude My discourse aspiring that all of you will become that kind of devotees. You have uttered the name of God and did namasmarana. You will also get the sacred prasadam, take that prasadam and enjoy the true bliss of God.",11/15/2015,Special_Occasion,Global Akhanda Bhajans
30,Premamrutham Inauguration,"In the same way as the reflection does not stick to the mirror, in the same way as the lotus leaves are not tainted by water in which they are there, the selfishness will keep away from a person if he has true devotion to God. This is the truth which I want to communicate to you this evening. Peace has vanished, Truth is in the background and the fear of weapons has increased beyond limits. For all this the root cause is human selfishness. This is the truth that I would like to communicate to you this evening.
Embodiments of Divine Love, Devotees, Students, Boys and Girls, Young men and Young women and Children!
Why does a man go down and lose all his happiness? The simple reason is his selfishness. Wherever there is selfishness, there cannot be any peace of mind. In order to attain his selfish ends, man has lost all the human values and is behaving like an animal. Even in this age when the whole of mankind is filled with very severe ego and selfishness, devotion alone can stand in good stead in our lives. As was told by Srinivas, the five human values are Truth, Love, Righteousness, Peace, and Non-Violence. If these values have to be installed in our hearts the first thing that is required is love for God. Wherever there is love of God, there is going to be fear of sin. Whichever society has love for God, fear of sin and morality in society, there appears real peace. But even divine love is many times tainted by expectations and selfishness. But true devotee will not have any expectations. He does not want anything else except the grace of God. The heart of such a devotee will be full of pure and sacred love. 
What a scene today, such a great act! The cause and the credit should go to My devotees of Singapore. Last year when we celebrated Swami’s Birthday at this time all the devotees and students were seated in the open ground. Only Swami was seated on the stage. I did not like My children getting exposed to wind and cold on that day. Not only students, even elders and other devotees being subjected to that kind of suffering, I felt very bad. I told only one word to Narasimhamurthy. I said, “If for all the devotees and children we can put up a shed or a mansion for them to sit, how great it would be.” When he discussed with the Singapore devotees, he explained this to them. The Singapore devotees came to Me with a letter offering to build not a shed but a real divine, very vast auditorium within ten months. Even when they came forward, this doubting Thomas, Narasimhamurthy, had many doubts. He asked himself these questions whether such a vast auditorium was required for us, whether we should spend so much money on it. He also had a doubt in such a remote village whether devotees would come here and would there be a time when this hall would be full of devotees? He also had the question, “This has not happened in the last forty years. Would it happen now?” I told him, “Definitely it is going to happen. Devotees are not coming for the sake of you; they are coming for the sake of Me.	If people come for your darshan, a small room is enough; but for Me, a big hall is also not enough.” In the first meeting itself, the hall is full of devotees and there are people even outside. 
All this is happening because Swami is here now. What we think exists really does not exist, what we think does not exist, that is the one that exists. Only that Divine or God is existing. This world and Creation is an illusion. Know the Truth. To think that only those things which we can see with our eyes are the truth is a mistake. Generally, people think that what they see with their physical eyes is the only truth. You are able to see the sugar but can you see the sweetness? You can see the salt but can you see the taste of the salt? Wind is all around us, can we see the wind, can we catch it or hold it? Though these things are not seen, only through experience you can know them.
God cannot be comprehended with the mind nor can be described in words. God who is the resident of your heart, you can experience Him only within your heart. If you put in any quantum of effort to see Him outside, all that will be useless. You can find Him only in the place where He is really there. For the sake of inspiring that kind of spiritual effort, I have built this big hall. But all of you will have to experience and see Swami within your hearts and enjoy that bliss. If it is possible for one person, you should know that it is possible for everyone. Because I pervade everybody equally. Divinity is inside us; we have to put in the spiritual effort, sadhana, in order to find Him. Water is there in the bowels of the earth; unless you sink a borewell, you cannot find water. Because of the rock, the soil and stones which can be compared to tamasik, rajasik, satvik qualities in us, we are not able to find the water of divinity. The attributeless God can be attained only when we conquer these qualities. You can find fulfilment in your lives only through devotion to God. We talk about the human values of truth, righteousness, peace, love and non-violence. But most important human value is devotion to God. You just have the devotion to God, it is enough. You have to develop that kind of pure and sacred love which is not tainted by desires and expectations. If such people with pure love are there, they need not come in search of Me, I will be behind them.
I have built this big mansion in order to make people understand and recognize this great power of supreme, selfless love. Within a short time, I will come again as Prema Sai and in the same hall, I will grant My darshan, I will bless My devotees, I will shower My Love and Grace on My devotees in the form of Prema Sai. That is why if you look behind, you find on one side Shirdi Sai is sitting, on the other side, Sathya Sai is sitting. In the centre we have left the place for Prema Sai.
Many devotees say we don’t want Shirdi Sai, we don’t want Prema Sai; it is enough if we have Sathya Sai. The forms may be many, but the Divine Principle is one and the same. If you eat mysorepak or gulab jamoon or mithai, all of them are sweet in their taste. We should depend on this Divine Principle which is inside, not depend on the external form in which He manifests.
My plan is a Master plan; it is not an ordinary plan. It is My desire that through the radio Sanathana Vani we should spread the principles of Sanathana dharma, which is nothing but hrudaya dharma, which is the dharma of the human heart. Sanathana means that which is eternal, which has no beginning, which has no end, which has no middle. That is love. We are starting this radio with the only desire and purpose that you should develop love in your heart and share it with others. Through this radio we propagate not only the teachings of Sai but the teachings of all the Masters, of all the Messiahs, and of all the religions. Because there is only one Truth. All of them teach there is only one Truth, scholars call it by different names. Therefore, we should harmonise and we should synthesise the teachings of everyone and we should propagate this kind of unity and oneness.
There are lot of scriptures written about God. A lot of devotees worshipped God, adored Him, praised Him in many ways. Today Swami is very happy that Swami Himself wrote a book and offered it to the devotees. This has not happened in any yuga or any Age. No Avatar did this. No prophet or messiah ever wrote a book for the sake of His devotee. But if you want to describe the devotion of the devotee about whom I wrote the book, I can’t really describe that love. I don’t have such great devotees like Indulal Shah and Sarla Shah in the whole world. Even when I am not seen, they recognized Me, they loved Me, they offered their body, mind and wealth for My Mission. Only once I told Indulal Shah, “We are developing many institutions; we need support, we also need the resources.” Immediately he offered the home in which he lived ‘Sai Darshan’, documented and offered it to Swami. His daughter, Darshana and son-in-law, Dr. Atul Patel, also supported this gesture of Indulal Shahji without putting any obstacles or raising any objections.
The local representatives -the Members of Legislative Assembly and the Member of the Parliament- have offered free land for building Sri Sathya Sai Sarla Memorial Hospital here.  We are going to start the construction immediately and we are going to complete and establish this hospital before the next Birthday.
Similarly even our Srinivas is offering everything - all his wealth, time and energy – in order to start hospitals in Swami’s healthcare mission. Already the Raipur Hospital has been established and more than 2000 cardiac surgeries on children have been performed till now. Everything is completely free. We don’t take a single naya paisa from anybody. Whichever educational institutions or healthcare institutions we start, we render service completely free of any cost and charges.
Srinivas and Narasimhamurthy are like my right hand and left hand and they are doing all the works I command them to do. One is education, another is healthcare. In the coming years, the educational institutions, the healthcare institutions in the name of Sathya Sai are going to come up all over India and they are going to become the most important institutions in the whole country.
How do you know there was a rainfall? Look at the soil; it is wet, then we know there was rain. All these institutions are running not because of them; but there is only one reason all these institutions are running - because Swami is here now with us.
The service that all of you have done getting together with complete unity have given Me great divine joy and bliss. To the contractors, the architect, and the engineers and workers, I would like to convey that I bless them and I shower My Grace in abundance. In spite of many obstacles like incessant rain, they never stopped the work, they went on doing the work. They had only one desire that we have to offer this auditorium at the Lotus Feet of Swam before Swami’s Birthday; that was their only desire.
You have decided to attain something; never give up the effort in the middle. You have asked for something; never give up before it is given to you. You have desired something; do not give up before the desire is fulfilled. But it is not the hallmark of the devotees to stop in the middle and give up. Because of all these people working with so much of dedication, love and determination, we are able to inaugurate this hall today.
Even the Trustees have worked day and night and have been able to achieve this.
On behalf of My devotees I offer My gratitude to all these people, blessing you abundantly, showering My Grace abundantly, I conclude My discourse this evening. My Grace and Blessings are there on every one of you in abundant measure. It is My aspiration that all of you would utilize the sacred opportunity given to you, develop love, share love with everybody	and enjoy divine Bliss.",11/18/2015,Special_Occasion,Miscellaneous
31,Evening Satsang,"God has neither birth or death. He has no beginning, He has no end and He has nothing called that middle. He is everywhere in the form of the atma and He lives in the hearts of every being in this universe.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
This morning we have understood to some extent what is the goal of human life. The goal of life or the purpose of life is not being born again and again, dying again and again and residing in the womb of the mother again and again. The ultimate purpose of life is to lead our lives in such a way that we realise our own divinity and also recognize the divinity in everyone. Without doing this, whatever else you might do and achieve in your lives, all that is a complete waste. From many countries many young men and young women have come here. They also know in order to reach Muddenahalli first they have to come to Bangalore; from there they can reach Muddenahalli. Whether they came from Italy or America or Australia, all of them knew in order to reach Muddenahalli, first they have to reach Bangalore, so purchased air tickets to Bangalore. Without purchasing the air ticket to Bangalore, if they purchase any other air ticket to any other destination it is not useful. You know in order to reach Muddenahalli first you have to reach Bangalore. With that knowledge you made all the arrangements and reached here. If we do not know our destination where we are heading to, we cannot travel. Only when you know within your minds that the goal of life is God realization and you have to lead a life in such a way as to realise God,  only then you can reach the destination. Only then we will put in effort to do everything that is required to reach our destination. 
But if you look at the young men and women in the world today we find that that they are in a state of total confusion and leading a life in total confusion. They are not aware why they are studying what they are struggling for and what is their goal in life. Though they all the time they struggle to attain happiness, but it is far away from them. They are not able to experience happiness.  People think if we earn money, if we attain name and fame we will get happiness but they don’t get it that way. When they earn money their desires will grow in number and that leads to compete restlessness in them. Desires keep growing from one to the other they will never decline. Because of desires being added day by day to our lives, the devotion is decreasing. 
A man without devotion to God is no man at all. Only when we develop love for God we can understand our own human nature. Where can we attain God? How do we reach God’s proximity? How can we attain bliss in our lives? How can we recognize our own true nature? Today we will know to some extent the answer to all these questions.
Human life is very precious. To attain human birth among the 84 lac species is very, very difficult. After having attained this glorious and divine human life it is absolutely necessary we utilize the opportunity very well. Because we do not know the value of our own life we are misusing the opportunity.
There was a cowherd boy; he went to graze his cows and somewhere he found a diamond. But he does not know it was a diamond because he was totally ignorant. He thought that it was a shining stone and picked it up. And he put that stone around the goat’s neck.  There was a baby goat which he loved very much, he caught hold of it and tied the stone around the neck of the goat. And that fool was very happy looking at the shining stone on the neck of the baby goat. They were roaming around the place till evening and finally returned to the village. Even in darkness that diamond was shining. There was a diamond merchant in that village. The diamond merchant came to him and asked him. “Where did you get this?” “When I was wandering in the forest, I found this stone.” “Will you please give me this stone?” He said, “My goat is looking so beautiful with the stone around its neck; I am not going to give it.” And the baby goat was very beautiful; what is that beauty? In fact, all the joy was in his eyes not in the goat actually. The baby goat does not know what that stone was. Because of his attachment to the baby goat, he tied that stone around its neck and he was very happy. But the diamond merchant persisted telling him, “I will give you one thousand rupees. Give me the stone.” One thousand rupees is a big money. He said, “My goat will lose its beauty. Therefore, I will not give that stone to you.” Then the merchant repeated, “I will give you five thousand rupees; will you give me that stone?” And he wondered whether he would get five thousand rupees for that stone. Still he said, “I am not going to give it to you.” Then the diamond merchant told him, “I will give you ten thousand rupees.” Once he thought he would get ten thousand rupees he decided to give that stone to the merchant. But he contemplated and reflected and found out, “This merchant first he said he was giving me one thousand, now he is saying ten thousand; that means this stone must be much more valuable than what he is offering.” Once he realized the precious value of the stone, immediately he removed the stone from the neck of the baby goat and put it in his pocket. 
This boy though he found a very precious diamond because he was ignorant of its precious value, he tied it around the neck of the goat and was happy. We are not able to understand how precious the human life is. We are not able to recognize the precious value of every moment in our life. We are not able to realise that God has given such a glorious and divine human life.
Who can understand this value? Only those who are about to lose their loves will understand the value of life. You go to a cancer patient and ask him, “What is the value of a human life?” He will tell you, “I can’t describe what is the value of human life.” You ask the parents that come to the Raipur hospital with a child who has a hole in the heart; you ask them the question what is the value of human life, they will answer your question properly. Ask the poor people who don’t have food clothing and shelter what is the value of human life, they will be able to give you the right answer.
God has given us everything but we are not able to understand the value of human life and we are misusing it. We are losing this precious human life in pursuit of the pleasures of the body and senses. The human life is diminishing every moment like a melting ice.  It is not growing; every moment it is diminishing in size. If you want to reach the destination using our human life very well, first we have to recognize the value of every moment of our life. 
Start early, drive slowly and reach safely. When you start early, there is no hurry, you will drive slowly and there will be no accidents. When you are a child and a boy, all the time you are interested in games and sports. When you become a youth, you are interested in pursuing sensual pleasures. When you become old, you are full of worries. Nobody is interested in God. When we start on our journey at such a young age, we can move slowly and ultimately reach the God. Slowness is life is very important for us. At this age if you cannot do it, later if you think of doing it, it is never possible. One day or the other each of us will have to discover our own divinity.
The students know it very well. When the dates of the examination are announced, they have to keep in minds the dates of the exams and study well and prepare for the exams. They know there is the examination, they also know they have to study quite a lot. But without putting time to good use if they misuse it, finally they will be subjected to difficulty.
Death is inevitable, inescapable for everyone. The life before we die we have to lead in such a way that we are happy with ourselves and not feel sad. In order to attain immortality, sacrifice is very important. The body is temporary. Therefore, don’t be proud of your young age and also the people who support you and wealth. One moment can take away all this from you. But atma is eternal; is there in every one. Only our behavior confirms with the atma within, we can attain the immortality. There is only one atma who pervades all the Creatures in the world. “I am One. I became many.” God is the One and the only One without the second. There is only one Truth; scholars call it by different names.
If we want to attain the unity of all existence, first of all we have to give up our ego and attachments. If you want to do it, first and foremost we should know properly what is the goal of our lives. When we ask the students “What do you want to become?” they say, “I will become a doctor, I will become an engineer, I will become a teacher, I will become a businessman.” Everybody is giving a different answer to that question. Nobody is saying, “I am going to become divine.”
Therefore, first and foremost you should become the goal of life ‘Becoming Divine’. What is divinity? Purity is divinity. What is purity? Selflessness is purity. Love without any expectations, without any desires is divine love. But we have to perform our duties. When we do our duties without love it becomes a burden for us. Duty without love is deplorable. Duty with love is desirable. Love without duty is divine. 
Kumar said that Srinivas went to Raipur and built the hospital. What is the relationship between the people of Raipur and Srinivas? Srinivas was not born in Raipur, was not brought up there. But he recognized the relationship of the atma with everybody that is why he went there and is serving everyone there.  
When you serve your blood relatives, it will become only duty with love; it is love without duty.  Only when we have love without duty, we become divine. You have to serve your parents. You have to look after your friends and relatives. But more importantly we have to serve those people with whom we recognize the relationship of the atma, that is the correct principle. That is why I have been telling you the same atma is there within everybody. Only if you put this precious human life to good use, then you will derive some reward out of it.
When you grow old, when body becomes infirm and weak if you want to serve others, it is not possible. Yesterday a great cricket player, Sunil Gavaskar, came here. And even in a cricket match the balls are being bowled. Even from the beginning you have a steady scoring rate of runs, finally you will not be subjected to any hurry. If you don’t score runs in the beginning and waste your time and finally you want to score runs, it is going to be very difficult and dangerous. Therefore, youth is the spring time in the human life. You have strength in your hands. You also have good intelligence in your mind. And if you develop devotion in your heart, all three together grant you mukthi or liberation. Therefore, when we develop the strength and also intelligence and also bhakthi, devotion, then you will reach liberation that is mukthi. Devotion is love for God without any expectations. But where is God? Is He in the temple? Is He in the masjid? Is He in the church? Is He in gurudwara? Not at all! And He is there in the form of atma in everyone. That is why service to man is service to God. When you serve people, you are serving God Himself. The best way to serve God is to Love All, Serve All.
Srinivas and Narasimhamurthy are demonstrating this truth to everyone. I didn’t want to talk it but now I want to tell you all this. For the last three years I have been telling Srinivas I want to start a hospital in and around Delhi. And he also wants to establish to establish a hospital in Delhi. There are a lot of poor people living in and around Delhi; it is very difficult for them to come to south India. Delhi is quite close even to the people of Kashmir or Uttar Pradesh or Bihar or Rajasthan. If we build a hospital near Delhi, all these people will get some help and facilities. People they are so poor they can’t purchase a train ticket to come to southern India. If they want to get any surgery done, it is almost impossible for them. Because I told him we should establish a hospital near Delhi, he is going around, wandering looking for the proper places. After establishing the Raipur Hospital, we have already exceeded 2000 surgeries in that hospital. When I told him that we should also establish a hospital in Delhi, he was ready. I also commanded that all My devotees should support this cause. Lot of devotees came forward and help this cause. Finally, when you find the proper site for the hospital, it is necessary you have to pay the advance and get into an agreement for getting that land. With the desire that we should establish the hospital in Delhi before 90th birthday he is mortgaging all his personal properties for this cause and getting a bank loan for this. His wife and child both are cooperating with him for doing this. He has no sense of fear of any kind. When you have faith, where do you get the fear from? Where there is faith, there is no fear. Where there is fear, there is no faith. I know that Srinivas would not like My telling you all this. But I want to demonstrate a good ideal for you; that is why I am telling you all this. He joined our College. And in every degree examination, he secured the gold medal. He is such a brilliant person he could have got any kind of big job anywhere. He and his mother both of them dedicated themselves completely to the service in Swami’s Mission and he has been doing this continuously. Because of his selfless sacrifice, I am sure that the hospital will come up within one year and the surgeries will be done in the Delhi hospital.
This is what is divinity. Selflessness is divinity. Selflessness is the ultimate divinity. That purity, sacredness is, divinity. My dears, when we came into this world, we did not bring anything. When we leave this world, we don’t take anything with us. Whatever we achieve in this life will remain on this earth. Only truth and good name will come with us. Whatever you achieve in this transient world are transient, nothing can be eternal. But your good acts, good service, love that you shower on others – that will remain eternally in the hearts of people who receive your love and service. If you can attain that kind of complete selflessness, that is divinity, that is the ultimate goal of life.
You may do hard penance. By that you may get some powers or siddhis, but you will never get divinity.  You can attain divinity only in the path of selfless love and selfless service and not in any other path.  If you want to become selfless, you have to get rid of fear. The fear comes because of the body. When you develop body consciousness, fear also emerges. When you develop divine consciousness, you will not have any fears. Atma has no birth, no death. It is always there, eternally. When you recognise this atmic principle which is divinity itself then you will be completely free from every fear.
It is My desire that so many of our young men and young women have come here; they are listening to the lectures of great personalities; they have to understand and put them into practice and use them well.
I have told our Chikkaballapur MLA. I told him you just get the government permission for getting Cauvery water to Chikkaballapur. I will put the pipelines and fill up all the tanks. I have already directed Kondal Rao, the Chief Engineer of Andhra Pradesh to prepare a project for materializing this. He has already decided what is the length of the pipeline, which are all the tanks and reservoirs we have to fill.
Because I gave a promise that before this Birthday I will give you plenty of water, what did not happen on the earth, the rain came down from the heavens and filled all the tanks. 
There are many people who serve Me. If I just Will the whole world will join My Mission. I am giving you this glorious opportunity with the only desire that you would put it into good use and attain your divinity. We should not think that we are serving somebody else, we are serving ourselves. We are serving everybody in order to attain self-satisfaction not for the satisfaction of others. When you attain self-satisfaction, you can also attain self-realisation. 
My dears!  Whatever you want to do, first you contemplate, discriminate in your mind whether it is divine, whether it is desirable, then only you do it. Tomorrow I am going to tell you about the wonderful qualities of viveka, discrimination and vairagya, detachment. Today we have understood that attaining divinity is the goal of our life. We also have learnt in order to become divine, we have to give up what is not divine in us. We have also understood for doing it, devotion to God is very important. We have also reminded that in order to develop devotion to God, young age is the right age to develop it. If we just develop devotion it is not enough, how to develop utilize devotion with the proper discrimination and detachment, we are going to understand tomorrow. If we have the discrimination and detachment with you, you can walk to any distance. When you discriminate what is eternal, what is permanent, what is temporary or transient, only then you can reach the goal. Through your temporary gains you will only get temporary pleasures, you don’t get permanent happiness. Temporary pleasures come and go, they are not permanent. Once you are happy, another time you are miserable. Tomorrow we will discuss how to attain something which is permanent and eternal.",11/19/2015,,
32,Morning Satsang,"The whole of Creation has emerged from the Truth and ultimately all Creation will merge back into Truth. If you try to look for a thing or a place which is not impacted by this Truth and you contemplate on it, you will find that is the ultimate pure Satva or the greatest Truth. This is the truth which all of you will have to recognize, experience and realise.
Embodiments of Divine Love, Young men, Young women, Students, Boys and Girls, and Devotees!
Our Upanishad declares to whole of mankind “O Children of Immortality, listen to this Truth!” Even the Swamiji who spoke before has addressed us as ‘Children of Immortality’. I also address you as ‘Embodiments of the Divine Atma’. The truth revealed by Vedas, the way Swamiji addressed you, the way I am addressing you - all that denotes only one thing that all of you are divine.
What is Truth? If we look outwardly, because we have got human bodies, we can consider ourselves as men and women. That is a fact but not the Truth. When the person is born, he is born with a very small body; he is called a child or a baby. After time passes, the body grows up; we address the same child as a boy. After some more years, you call him a young man. After he grows up for many, many years and the body starts deteriorating, you call him an old man. Depending on the changes that take place in the body, the body gets different names. People address the same person first as a boy then as a man then as an old man. All this is happening because of the changes happening in the human body. All this is just a fact but not the Truth. In Truth you will not find any changes with the passage of time. The Truth is the ancient one, the eternal one. It is very essential that we recognize the Truth and behave accordingly.
There was a sage by name Uddalaka; he had a son by name Shvetaketu. When the boy was of age to go to a school, the father sent him to a gurukula. But because of his arrogance the boy thought, “My father does not know anything; that is why he is sending me to another teacher in a gurukula.” After completing his education, Shvetakatu came back to his father Uddalaka. Uddalaka welcomed his son with great love and to know exactly what the boy had learnt, he asked him many questions. As Uddalaka asked the questions, Shvetaketu went on answering the questions. Finally, father asked the son, “Have you learnt that wisdom, that knowledge by knowing which you need not have to study anything more? Have you recognized the true nature of the ultimate Truth? Have you experienced the divinity of your own Truth?” He went on asking him the questions “What are the attributes of the divinity? What is the form of divinity? What is the quality of divinity?” Shvetaketu who was gloating with pride that he had learnt great education was trying and stumbling to answer father’s questions. Shvetaketu answered his questions in many ways but father was not satisfied. Father ultimately gave the verdict that you have learnt only theoretical knowledge, you have not learnt practical knowledge. Father told the son to get some water in a vessel. He also told him to get a fistful of sugar. Father asked the son, “Where is the sugar?”  “It is in my hand,” he said.  “What is its quality? What is its attribute?” The son answered, “Sweetness is the taste of sugar.” Father asked him, “Can you find out its sweetness by looking at it or by just holding it in your hand?” The boy answered, “Only if you put in on the tongue, then you can know the sweetness of sugar.” And father commanded the son to put the sugar into the water and mix it up. When the question was asked to Shvetaketu, “Now where is the sugar?” he said, “It is in water.” But father asked him, “I am not able to see the sugar in the water. You are not able to see; how do you know that it is there?” Shvetaketu replied, “Like you put the sugar on your tongue; similarly, you put this sugar syrup on the tongue then you know it is sweet.” He also said, “Only when you experience you will recognize the Truth.”
Not by activity, not by wealth, not by progeny, only by sacrifice you can attain immortality. However much we may describe it, however much we may explain it and propound it, you will not be able to understand it. The only way to know the taste of divinity within ourselves is to experience that. We have to recognize the Truth though divinity is not seen with the physical eyes, it pervades every being. The mind cannot comprehend it, words cannot describe it. Then how can we recognize the divinity? We can’t see that, listen to it, you cannot catch it, you cannot hold it. How can we recognize such a truth? In the same way as you taste the sugar syrup and know that sugar is there, you have to experience your own divinity and recognise divinity.
Why did we organize this congregation? Its only purpose is to reveal to everyone the divinity within one and to demonstrate the fact that all are one. In a stone, there is the statue hidden inside. You can see on the stage the idols of Sai Baba and also Shirdi Sai but these idols have not come from somewhere else. These idols were already hidden in that stone of marble. When a sculptor removes what is not the idol in the stone, then the idol emerges. We should not think divinity is coming to us from elsewhere. You are the embodiment of divinity, you are the child of immortality, you are the very form of love. Only when we give up ego and attachments which are not our true nature, only then divinity will emerge in us. If you want to recognize the divinity within you, it is necessary that you give up what is not divine in you. The sadhana that we have to do is to give up all those qualities and things which are not divine. Then we can find our own divinity and also experience divinity in everyone. 
Look here, we have a kerchief. To catch hold of the kerchief is difficult but just to leave it away is very easy. Similarly, to get hold of and keep this ego and attachment within us is difficult. When you give it up, you experience great bliss. First and foremost, you have to annihilate the one ahamkara which is the ego. When a child is born, he keeps crying when he comes into the world. If you hear the subtle sound, you are hearing the question “Koham, koham, who am I?” The child is born into the world asking the question ‘Who am I?’ When he is asking the question ‘Who am I?’ you don’t tell him “You are the ever pure, ever blissful, ever truth divinity,” but you tell him “You are a boy. You are a girl. This is your name. This is your form.” Then this child who listens to this fact thinks that is the ultimate truth, he thinks he is the body. All the time he will keep thinking ‘I am the body’ and bases his behavior on that. He lives his life thinking he is only the body. When you have body consciousness, ego and attachment are inevitable. Though there are many pots and there is space and sky in every pot, you may think that is the space in the pot. But when you break the pot, the space inside and outside become one. In this pots of the human body we are experiencing differences. This body made up of five elements will have to ultimately vanish into five elements. This body which has come from dust will have to merge into dust. But it Is not the permanent one. But Truth is permanent. Through this we can demonstrate that the body is not the ultimate Truth. Truth is that which has no beginning which has no end, which has no middle. That which is eternal is the Truth. The divine principle within you is the Truth. But if we can give up those things which are not divine then we can recognize the Truth. 
All of you have come here not to attain divinity. You are 	the very form of divinity. All of you have come here to give up what is not divine in you, what is animal in you. When you ask the question “Koham? Who am I?” the right answer is “Soham, I am That.” Your own inhalation and exhalation are always teaching you “I am That, I am He, I am He.” You have to listen to this voice of your breath, recognize it and experience the Truth. 
The doctor who spoke before said in the country of America, the young people are getting subjected to depression. But what is the reason for this depression? Body consciousness is responsible for this depression. You live with body consciousness “I am this body, I am this name, I have this”, that is why you get into depression. If you keep on telling a child “You are a bad boy, you are a bad boy,” he will definitely become a bad boy. But if you tell him positively “You can become a good boy” he will also develop positivity. Speak the truth, speak truth pleasantly, don’t speak unpleasant truth. When we tell our children “You are this body, you are this name, you are this form” they will also live in that untruth. You should tell him positively “You are the divine.” True education is that education which teaches him this. Spiritual education is the highest education among all kinds of education. Therefore, you have to tell them the truth that “You are divine” then depression will vanish and there come compassion, love and service. Only when elders practice it, the youngsters would look at it and follow it.
 In youngsters there is great strength and also great brilliance of mind and also bhakthi, devotion. Because they have all the three things – head, heart and hands – strong, they can achieve anything. Only when we know what it is our destination, we will walk on the right path. If you want to go to Bangalore, you have to purchase a ticket to go to Bangalore and sit in the bus that goes to Bangalore. If you purchase a ticket to Hyderabad and you want to go to Bangalore, it is not possible. Therefore, first and foremost you should know what is the goal of your life. 
You were born asking the question “Who am I?” You should know the reply and answer “I am He.” “I am divine” – that is the Truth. When you ask the question “Who are you?” you should not think that “I am Narasimhamurthy” or “I am Srinivas.” “I am God.” Only when we know the divine truth there the darkness of ignorance will vanish, the light of wisdom will shine and we will experience divine joy. We are all here to get rid of the darkness of ignorance. Therefore, first and foremost we have to recognize that truth that all of us are one. Because of our ego and attachments, we are not able to recognize this truth. When you practice love and service, you can get rid of this ego and attachment. If you want to get rid of the slush of ego and the dirt of attachment, you have to use the water of love and the soap of service. When we involve ourselves in love and service, we can easily give up ego and attachment.
Governments and many huge institutions are trying to impart education to children but we find that all their efforts are a total waste. You spend crores of rupees, you build many institutions there is no transformation in the children. But because they are being given only the material and external education, but the Truth is internal. We should impart that education which teaches us the truth which is within us. Therefore, it is necessary we found and establish such institutions.
Why many young men and young women have come from all over the world to this little village? All of us are here to recognize this Truth. To recognize this Truth and cross over the ocean of birth and death, it does not happen with penance, by pilgrimages, study of scriptures; only by selfless service you can attain that. Selfless service is very important. When you are doing service, to develop ego is a mistake. We are doing service in order to get rid of ego. Doing service and developing more ego is not correct. We have to do service silently. Nobody should know the kind of service that we are rendering. You have to do it for your own happiness and self-satisfaction.
When the transformation takes place in you, you will recognize that you are a part of society. You are an individual. Individual is a limb of the society; society is a limb of Creation; Creation is a limb of God. The journey of our life is to grow from individual to society, from society to Creation and from Creation to God. That is what is meant by saying from I to We to He; from selfishness to selflessness and then to Divinity. 
You have to put this opportunity to good use, treat everyone as brothers and sisters, and if you have any questions you can write down and give it to elders. I will not be able to talk to you individually but I will answer all your questions. You should not go back the way you came here. Spoilt cars get into workshops; but when they return, they are repaired, they look good. A spoilt car comes to the workshop and returns the same way; it is useless. You are not spoilt cars; all of you are good cars. Even for good cars, servicing is required. Only when you are doing servicing properly, car will be maintained properly. Therefore in human life, service is very important. When you are doing proper service, this body, heart and your mind will be on the right lines. All of you are here in order to learn this truth of service. When you go back, you should go with more love, more selflessness, more sense of adventure and more work – service. Enthusiasm, sense of adventure, courage, intelligence, strength, valour. Where there are these six qualities, there divinity is installed.
This is your spring time. When you learn the truths at this age, whole of your life will be blissful. All the time I am telling the students, “Till now the world recognized you as the devotees of Sai Baba. When a boy is young, he is recognized as the son of so-and-so. When the boy grows up, gets education and gains name and fame, then father is recognized as the father of so-and-so. Till yesterday the world recognized you because of Me, now onwards people have to recognize Me because of you. When the world looks at you and sees Sai Baba’s students, Sai Baba’s youth, men and women are so selfless and so much enthusiastic to serve and they are full of love, then they will recognize their Divine Master, how is Sai Baba. This great responsibility is on your shoulders and I expect that all of you will discharge this responsibility very well. 
My Grace and Blessings are there in abundance for every one of you. In the coming days, you will listen to many such good words, also involve in village service activities. When you go back, you should be transformed young men and young women. If you light one lamp of love, through that you can light many lamps of love. You have to find fulfilment in your lives by lighting the lamp of love in your hearts and sharing it with others.",11/19/2015,,
33,Evening Satsang,"God shines forth in the universe, the universe shines forth in God; the sweet relationship between the Lord and His Creation can never be separated. This is the truth, the word of Sai, the path of Truth.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
There is no devotee without God and there is no God without a devotee. There cannot be a mother without a child and there cannot be a child without a mother. The single reason why so many of the devotees have gathered here is that God Himself is here now. Though He cannot be seen, He cannot be listened to but all of us can know the truth that God is here in our own hearts. Only in a pure and sacred heart, God will manifest and we can see Him. 
On this stage we have a curtain. In front of the curtain, all of you are sitting. Behind the curtain I am sitting. Only when the curtain is opened you can see Me, I can see you. As long as the curtain is closed, you cannot see me and I cannot see you. What is this curtain? Curtain is just a cloth. This cloth has got its form because all along the threads run in that cloth vertically and horizontally. Because so many threads are there, this cloth also exists. 	With that kind of cloth we have made a curtain and we have closed the stage. Till I was in the physical body, I came out of the curtain and granted My darshan to you. But now if you want to see Me, you have to come and open the curtain. The curtain exists because of the warp and the woof, the horizontal and vertical threads in the cloth. Because of the threads of ego and attachment this curtain of mind is separating us.
This whole Creation is based on the mind. Mind is responsible both for our bondage and liberation. Because of the ego and attachment in our minds, we are not able to see God. But gradually if you remove one thread after the other, remove all threads, then the curtain will disappear. These threads are nothing but the desires and expectations that are born out of our ego and attachment. Because we have so many desires this curtain of mind obstructs us from seeing God. If you keep on adding one desire after the other it is like adding one thread after the other to the curtain. The curtain is becoming thicker and thicker because of these desires. Similarly if you can remove one thread after the other finally you can remove the curtain itself. 
If everyone wants to see or realize their divinity within a day, it is almost impossible. But gradually if you can give up one selfish desire every day and develop selfless love and involve ourselves in selfless service, one day or the other we will be able to remove this curtain. It is very essential that we remove this curtain which is made up of the three attributes of tamas, rajas and satva. If we want to realize our own divinity we have to completely get rid of our ego and attachment. Therefore, before we do any act we need to discriminate and do it. You have to ask yourself the question, “With this act, whether my curtain of mind is becoming thicker or thinner? Whether this act will take me nearer to God or away from God?”
In the word ‘Paropakara’ which means helping others, there are three single words, ‘Para’, ‘Upa’, ‘Kara’. ‘Para’ means God, ‘Upa’ means proximity, ‘kara’ means which takes you. Only those acts of helping others will take us nearer to God. But criticizing others, ridiculing others will take us away from God; that will not take us nearer to God. Based on this, I have been always telling you ‘Help Ever, Hurt Never’. You may study any number of scriptures – Vedas, Upanishads or any other scriptures of any other religions – the ultimate essence is one. There is only half a sentence that gives the essence of all the eighteen Puranas composed by Bhagawan Vyasa ‘Helping others is merit, Hurting others is sin’. We have to utilize this body for helping others. When we have concern for others, when we have love for others, when we serve others, the ego and attachment in us will diminish day-by-day. Therefore it is very essential that we use our discrimination. Whatever we think, whatever we speak, whatever we do whether it is going to take us nearer to God or away from God. ‘Viveka’ or discrimination is a great gift which helps us in recognizing what is true, what is eternal, what is permanent, what is temporary, what is transient and what is untrue. 
God has gifted this talent of discrimination only to man and not to any other creature. Just walking on two feet and being able to speak and studying many kinds of education, getting degrees is not true education. Unless you develop discrimination you are not really educated. When we use discrimination and put it to good use then definitely we can get nearer to God by doing things which will take us nearer to Him. Therefore, run away from bad company, get into good company, day and night you involve yourself in noble acts, all the time contemplate on what is permanent and what is impermanent. Only when we use our discrimination to know what is permanent and what is impermanent we will be able to do those things which will give us permanent happiness.
Just knowing is discrimination, but doing is detachment. Many people to some extent have this viveka. They are able to know what is good and what is bad. But they are not ready to do what is good. They are all the time running forward to do wrong things but never coming forward to do good things. When we want to do good things, you should do it immediately, you should not postpone. When we get bad thoughts and negative thoughts we should keep postponing them. If you postpone evil things, naturally one day or the other, they will disappear. Only when we train our mind this way you will be able to recognize the divinity. 
My dears, you did not start walking as soon as you were born. You did not speak when you were born. You could not read and study any books. But by gradual practice and attempt you have been able to do all this now. By practice we can also make our mind steady. In a steady mind you can see the pure reflection of the akasha i.e. space. Not only steady mind there should be pure waters for reflection. Only when you have in the lake pure and steady water, you can see the clear reflection of the sky. Lot of young people have pure mind but they don’t have a steady mind. But many people have a steady mind but not a pure mind. Therefore both are required for us.
If you want to have the darshan of Swami, because He is inside you, you have to see Him inside you. See Always Inside – SAI – that is the Sai principle. Seeing outside is illusion or maya. Only if you look inside you can attain God. What do you get? You will get two degrees – BA BA. The first degree is Bliss and Awareness. Being Always is the second degree. Sat chit ananda – Being awareness and bliss - is nothing but the double degree BA BA. This divine experience will stay eternally with you only if you can realize that. In order to gain this experience it is essential you purify your mind. It is essential you remove this curtain which is full of ego and attachment.
Spiritual path is not for those weak minded people. The spiritual path is only for the bold and the courageous. Because you have to give up what is not good; for that a lot of courage is required. The mind always keeps on aspiring for the wrong and bad things. The heart always aspires for good things. Only when you obey your heart you can practice discrimination. How do you know it is the heart that is speaking to you? All the things that mind tells you are full of selfishness, never selfless. The mind is always full of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, it doesn’t think of ‘ours’ and ‘we’. If you obey your mind, you will get into restlessness, you don’t get peace. All the doubt the mind will haunt you. A doubt persists whether “I have done it correctly or still I have to learn?” As soon as you obey and do what your heart tells you, immediately you will get ultimate peace. The third thing the mind always tells us selfish things, only about our own welfare. The mind does not think of everyone. Before we decide upon doing anything, we have to use our discrimination. Is it selfish or selfless? Is it good only for me or for everybody? If I do it will I get closer to God or get away from God? When I do it will I become restless or attain peace of mind? When you use your discrimination this way you will get the right answer from your own heart.
Many of you think Swami is here, now He is telling us so many good things; when we go back to our countries how do we contact Him? My dears! Swami is everywhere all the time. The radio vibrations are the waves; they are there everywhere. You can listen to those songs only if you tune your radio. When you tune the radio to bad station, you will get bad songs. When you tune the radio to the good station, you get good songs. Therefore the mind of radio should be tuned to God. When we offer all our thoughts, words and deeds to God, then it is the right tuning of the mind.
Spirituality is not such a difficult thing. Bad teachers make simple lessons very complicated. But good teachers simplify the complicated lessons. Because Swami is telling everything in a very simple way you may get a doubt “Does Swami know about all these things or is Swami just telling us?” When great scholars come to you, quote from the scriptures like Vedas and Upanishads then you respect Him. I want to tell you the path of spirituality is very simple, very easy. Just offer everything to God. All actions should be done for the love of God. But if you think something is not worthy of offering to God, you should not do it. Whether Swami would like these thoughts? If I use these words will Swami like it? If you do these actions, can we offer them to God? If you think something is not worthy of offering to Him then you should not do that. If you practice this kind of discrimination you can turn your life into a divine life.
You have to be in good company. In good company you will get good thoughts. You get bad thoughts in bad company. When dust gets into the company of wind, it goes up. When dust gets into the company of water, it goes down. Tell me your company, I shall tell you what you are! ABC of life is Avoid Bad Company. When we are in the good company all the time, we will have good thoughts all the time. When you sit here and listen to these things, you will decide you have to do good things. But when you go back you are not able to do it. Even when you go out of this place, when you are in good company, you can do it. Whichever country you come from – America or any other country – always you should have good company. You have to develop good thoughts in good company. Good thoughts should become good words. Good words should get transformed into good actions. 
Sow a thought, reap an action! Sow an action, reap a habit! Sow a habit, reap a character! Sow a character, reap destiny! When we sow the seeds of good thoughts naturally you will get good rewards. Therefore we should all the time discriminate whether it is a good thought or a bad thought, good words or a bad word, good action or a bad action. Immediately we should do good things and you should postpone the wrong things. As you keep on postponing, one day it will disappear.
Sri Krishna went to Karna. When he went there, Karna was applying oil on his hair. The vessel containing oil was in the left hand; with the right hand he was applying it on his head. Krishna went there and said, “You give me something in charity. You have to give that vessel with oil to me.” With his left hand only immediately he gave it to Krishna. In our culture we should not do anything with the left hand. You have to do everything with the right hand. “You are a man of great charity but you don’t know how to do the charity. Why are you giving me this with your left hand and not your right hand?” Then Karna said, “Lord, You are God. When You come and ask me for something, I just wanted to do it immediately. Therefore, I gave it to you with my left hand. Because at the same time my mind may change if I postpone, that is why I did it. This moment I felt like giving you; therefore, I gave it to you. I am afraid next moment my mind may change. I am also afraid I may not be able to do such a noble act.”
Therefore, with that kind of determination when a good thought comes to you, you should implement it immediately. When you get a bad thought, you should postpone it. If you have both viveka and vairagya, discrimination and detachment, you can definitely conquer the battle of life. No need to read any big books. No need to listen to any lectures. Therefore, thinking in your mind whether it is good or bad and resorting to viveka and vairagya is very important.
All of you have listened to such good talks. You should not listen with one ear and leave them out with the other ear. Whatever you listen, preserve in your mind and put them into practice.
When I went to Nigeria, I saw all the children there. Our Father with great love is bringing them up. What for is he doing all this? He is doing it his for his own self-satisfaction; in fact, not for the children. “Why are you doing only this and not anything else?” “I know only one thing to love all and serve all. I don’t know anything else. I can’t do anything else other than that. It is my real nature. I don’t have anything else to do.” I cannot describe how much bliss I derived out of seeing those children. Those children are going to come here for Christmas and they are going to sing the Christmas songs. 
Even I can’t describe how good and noble Dr. Shaun Setty is. He came as a young boy to Me. I told Him whatever you do, offer it to God; that is enough. He looks like an ordinary person, but he is a very great paediatric cardiac surgeon. He has been himself going to Raipur and performing many surgeries and also get things and equipments required for the hospital. Because he is a doctor, he is serving as a doctor. If you are a teacher, serve as a teacher. In whichever profession you are, there is scope for service. 
Even before you do service you should develop the attitude to offer everything to God. Then work becomes worship and duty becomes God. It is not just enough you should offer everything you do to God. At the same time, you should give up the desire for the fruits of action. Whenever - whether it is a good one or a bad one – we offer everything to God, we will not get those rewards. I will tell you some other time what is this karma, law of action and reaction and how to go out of it or conquer that law.
To recapitulate, yesterday you learnt that the ultimate goal of life is God realization and you have to utilize your life for that. Today you learnt in order to get rid of ego and attachment which are obstacles to realization, we can do it only through discrimination and detachment. Tomorrow we will learn about the law of action and reaction and how to offer all actions to God. By tomorrow when we finish this course, you will get rid of all doubts and you will be clear in your minds. But in spite of that if you have some doubts and questions, you write on a piece of paper and give it to Narasimhamurthy; I will be able to answer you. But that is only a temporary solution, not a permanent one. Ultimately what we need to do is consult God who is within your heart and do what He tells you to do. All the time He is ready to answer your questions and solve your doubts but you are not asking Him. If you ask your questions to God who is within you, immediately you will get the answer. When you remove the noise of the mind and listen to the voice of the heart, then you will be able to know all the answers. If all the people sitting in the auditorium keep on talking, you will not be able to listen to what the speaker is speaking. When a speaker is speaking on the stage, everybody should listen to that and not to neighbours. Only then we can understand what the speaker is saying. Deep down in your heart, the eternal voice of God is always speaking but because of the ego and attachments, we are not able to listen to that. If you reduce the noise of the mind and listen to the voice of the heart, God will guide you every moment wherever you are.  If you practice this, definitely you can achieve this. However much you may describe a chapati or look at it or when you go for dinner you look at the menu and just read through it, will your stomach be filled? By reading the menu your stomach will not be filled. And only when you eat it, your hunger is satisfied. However much you listen, however much I say, that is just not enough. Only when you put into practice you understand the principle very well and enjoy the bliss.
This doctor’s son said, “It is not tomorrow or day after tomorrow; this moment we have to find fulfillment in our life. This moment we have to put it to good use, next moment will take care of itself.
I conclude My Discourse blessing and aspiring that whatever you listen, you understand it well and put into practice and enjoy the bliss; I conclude My Discourse.",11/20/2015,,

Embodiments of Divine Love!
This evening we have given to many of our students the ‘Best Student Award’ and also to teachers the ‘Best Teacher Award’. Suppose you ask the question what is the kind of education that is being taught to students and taught by the teachers, it is not just for eking out a living 	but for	....		.Our educational institutions are imparting apart from material education even spiritual education. Only when both kinds of education get together, the student can find fulfilment in his life. If you want to impart that kind of education, we do need good teachers. Even teachers in our educational institutions are highly enlightened, they are men and women of sacrifice and they are able to demonstrate the ....				.
If you ask the question why peace and truth have become rare in the society today, the root cause is the lack of spiritual education. Students attain education in order to gain their selfish ends and selfish goals and not for serving the society. In fact they are purchasing education, not exactly attaining education. Naturally when students spend money to gain education they would think of gaining money after education. Education has become a kind of commerce - we purchase education and also sell education. The kind of education which you purchase which has become a business cannot help you to get spiritual education.
Two parents came from Bangalore. I asked them, “What is that your children are studying?” The mother said just then her child had got admission to Pre KG. They were very happy that their child was studying in Bangalore. When I asked then, “How much fees are you paying for the child?” They said, “We can’t tell you that.” “I want to know, please tell Me.” For a primary school student, every year they are paying fees of one lac rupees. Apart from that they are paying many kinds of fees like sports fees, reading room fees, library fees and other fees. 
When money is paid for gaining education, naturally the students will aspire to gain and earn money. When parents work so hard, sacrifice and give education to their children, children thinking that they should also earn money and repay their parents is no surprise.
But in our educational institutions for all students we are giving completely free education. Last year in some of our institutions when some fees was being charged, Swami called the trustees and told them, “If you are charging fees for imparting education, you remove My name from the institution. Don’t name the institution Sathya Sai Vidya Niketanam; name it Narasimhamurthy Vidya Niketanam or Gangadhar Bhat Vidya Niketanam.” Wherever there is My name involved in the institution, when we utter the name of Sathya Sai educational institutions, education should be completely free. When you give free education to the students, they also develop a kind of social responsibility. 
Where do we get the money required for giving them free education? Naturally because the money for free education is coming from the society they also develop a magnanimous attitude that we should also help society. When you light one lamp, through that lamp you can light many lamps. We don’t need a matchbox for lighting every lamp. When you grant free education and combine it with spiritual education, naturally the student will also develop an attitude to help others. 
So many devotees have come here; they are observing how the children are getting academic education and also their character is being developed and they are very happy about it. It is necessary that the students should be grateful to the devotees who are enabling them to get free education. The devotees are doing all this for the sake of Swami even without mentioning their own names anywhere.
When I went to Gulbarga, we got all the sports and games material for Gulbarga campus from Bangalore. One devotee arranged to purchase and send all this to Gulbarga. Narasimhamurthy asked the boys, “All these sports and games materials have come from Bangalore. Do you know who has sent all this?” Poor Narasimhamurthy was thinking he wanted to tell them the name of the devotee who had supported and praise. But he was surprised hearing the answer that....
When....
That is the right answer.
When you think somebody is giving and somebody is receiving, naturally you develop a kind of ego. When you develop ego all the spiritual gains are lost. Whatever you do only when you do it selflessly -what you do with your right hand, the left hand should not know; nobody should know who is doing it, everybody should know that God is doing it - then our ego will not raise its hood.
You may become engineers and build big mansions; but have you created the five elements of earth, water, fire, space? Utilising all these materials , you are .....
You may study medical education.....
You may also perform complicated surgeries. Did you create the body? Did you give ....
God has created everything. That is why we are creating utilising those materials created. You may be an agriculturist farming the land; did you create the seeds? You are sowing the seeds given by God, in the land created by God watering with the water given by God; you are not really doing anything. You may become a great painter and earn great name and fame but did you create the colours? You may become a great musician and earn lot of fame but did you create the tunes and sounds? Not at all! God has created all this and you are utilising them for your livelihood. You may become a great teacher but you have not created wisdom and knowledge. God has created everything; we are utilising them and leading our lives.
All of you are sitting in this hall. Your heart is functioning all the time since your birth. Your inhalation and exhalation is taking place spontaneously; you are not doing anything. Food that you ate at noon will digest by itself; you are not putting any effort. When you ask the question, “Who is doing all this in our body?” The answer is God Himself is doing it. When God is doing everything we should not have any ego and attachment. Only when God maintains your body by doing all the activities inside the body, you are utilising the body and doing your work.
The body is the temple; and the person who resides is none other than God. When you earn money, gain name and fame and do some good work, when ego creeps in, you have to ask yourself this question; then you will know the truth. You may ride on elephants or horses; maybe you are praised sky high; maybe you are also called a mad man. Never forget God. Never give up chanting of the name. God is there inside you doing everything for you. That is why you are able to lead your life. You should not forget this truth, always think of God, adore Him and lead your life. 
Where is God? God is in every one. If you want to love God, there is no need for you to go any pilgrimage and go to some temple. You can love God and serve God everywhere. The best way to love God is to love all and serve all.
All our students should become men and women of sacrifice, put the opportunity given by Swami to good use and the support given by the devotees to good use and then they should lead their lives serving society and enjoying bliss. 
Today we have many cultural programmes. I have spoken for a while because I wanted to convey to you what I feel in My heart. So many devotees have come here; many devotees have supported this cause; that is why you are getting that kind of education. You have to utilise that education well and become men of sacrifice and serve the world.
Will all students become people of sacrifice? (Swami asked the students in the hall; they all responded enthusiastically.) When you utter such noble words, I will see that that will come true.",11/22/2015,,

True devotion to Me is for you to consider both gain and pain as equal.
Embodiments of Divine love, Devotees!
When a flower blossoms nobody need invite a bee. When a flower blossoms in a place all the bees will swarm around the flower; nobody need invite them. Wherever the sugar is there is no need to announce it to the ants; aspiring for the sweetness of the sugar, the ants by themselves spontaneously come to the sugar. Similarly there is no need to announce to the devotees where God exists.  True devotees looking for the divine sweetness of love on their own come to the personality of God.  When Swami was in the physical body people from all over the world swarmed to Him, wherever He was. But when He has shed the mortal coil and He is revelling in His original nature even then devotees are rushing towards Him.
If you ask the question why it is happening, even when He was in the physical body He always shared His love, showered his love on everybody; even now when He is without the physical body when He is there in His real, original nature, He is doing the same thing showering His Love and Grace on devotees. 
Love is not confined to the physical form. Many times it happens the sons and daughters will go to foreign countries for education when the parents are staying in another country. Though the son or daughter is not seen by the parents, the parents’ love for the children does not diminish in any way. All the time they are not able to see the son or daughter but the parents’ love does not diminish, it keeps on growing with the faith that he is there somewhere. Love is not confined by the limits of place, time and circumstances.
Swami is the very embodiment of love; that is why devotees come to Him to share His love. The relationship that exists between God and devotees is one of pure, unsullied, sacred love. However powerful a magnet is if the piece of iron is surrounded by rust and dust, it cannot be attracted by the magnet. For the iron piece to say that because it is not attracted, instead of recognising its own rust and dust, to say that the magnet has no power is a folly. Because of the evil qualities in us God is not attracting us. 
Even a magnet is a piece of iron and even a piece of iron is a kind of magnet. Before it became a magnet it was just a piece of iron. But in that piece of iron when all the atoms become unidirectional that is when it turns into a magnet. For great souls thought, words and deed are one and the same. When thought, word and deed are unified in us then we also get the magnetic power of divinity. It is necessary to achieve the unity of thought, words and deed.  It is very essential that we get rid of the rust and dust of ego and attachment.
You are all asking for the Birthday message; if at all I have to give a message, there is only one message I can give you.  
The best gift that you can give Me is to become Me. Everyone should get transformed into a Sai Baba. Every piece of iron already has magnetic power in it. When you get rid of attachment and ego putting in your soul and heart into that effort and also you develop that kind of love you also become a Sai Baba. Truly when will Swami be happy? When everyone is happy Swami is also happy. When you make everybody happy Swami becomes happy. But where does the happiness lie? Is it there in this world? Is it in name and fame, treasures and wealth? Not at all! But if really true happiness is there in power and wealth, name and fame then why is it people with all that are not happy? Happiness is union with God. Only when we commune with the divinity within we know truly what happiness is. All the time I have been telling you that you are the embodiments of the atma, you are the embodiments of love. I never addressed you as human beings. It is very essential you first and foremost you develop faith in My word that you are divine. You have to always declare yourself to be divine – “I am God, I am God, I am God.” Don’t belittle yourself by saying you are man. Children of immortality! You are children of immortality; you are not mortals. You have to always recognise your own divinity and keep you behaviour in accordance. Every thought, feeling, word and deed should become divine. Then you don’t remain mere mortals, you will become divine. Divinity is not coming from somewhere outside; it is already there within you. Your true nature is divinity. Because of your ego and attachment, you are not able to recognise your own divinity and you are subjected to all kinds of misery.
Therefore we have to develop the faith we are embodiments of bliss, we are embodiments of divinity, we are embodiments of the pure spirit. Tat paraha! You should have the behaviour in accordance with your divine nature. When you are divine you should behave in a divine way. Why are we not able to do that?
It is because of our selfishness and self interest we are not able to behave in a divine way. Where does selfishness come from? Because of lack of faith you develop all the negative qualities like fear. When you have complete faith that you are divine, you are an embodiment of love and atma, then there is no scope for any kind of fear. 
You have to value My word, listen to it, contemplate on it, practise it then you and I will become one. I don’t need any gift from you. I am there in everything. I don’t consider others as others. But if you do only one thing, as your mother as your father, I will rejoice. If you put into practice whatever I tell you and become divine, become selfless and become pure and give that joy to everybody, as a father and mother, I will be very happy.
Never have any doubts within. Never start with negative thoughts “Is it possible for me”? That is possible for everybody; that is your true nature. In fact it is very easy for you to behave according to your true nature. You face all difficulties when you don’t behave in accordance with your true nature of divinity. When you secure such firm faith that you are divine then you can carry on the journey very easily.
Lot of youth, young men and women, and lot of devotees have come from many countries. Nobody knows whether you will get this opportunity once again. Therefore the opportunity given to you just now should be put to good use.  My grace and blessings are there on every one of you in abundance. You have to put this grace to good use. Anybody helps me, anybody tries to obstruct me, I am not going to stop My work. I will never stop loving anybody. Even when anybody ridicules Me or criticises Me i will not give up My true nature of love and I will love them also. Therefore, you should recognise your true nature as love and live with love, deal with others with love and serve others.
When all the youth come back next year for a similar meet there should be great transformation in all of them. 
Will all of you come back next year? Come back as better persons. Then I will be happy. Be happy, make others happy; then Swami will be happy. When divinity is born in your heart that is my Birthday.

Embodiments of Divine Love!
The physical, inert body is made up of five elements – earth, water, fire, wind and space. Similarly even the spiritual content of the human personality also has five elements. Only when a man practises the five human values of truth, righteousness, peace, love and non-violence	he can be called a man. In the same way as the physical body is created out of five elements, even the spiritual personality of man is created by the conglomeration of all these five human values.
With a subtle analysis you can easily find that the basis of earth is water. For water the basis is fire. For fire the basis is wind. For the wind space is the basis. Taittiriya Upanishad explains how each of these elements came from the preceding one. From the space comes the wind, from the wind comes the fire, from the fire comes water, and from the water comes earth. If you look into the composition of anything in the universe, you know that space is an integral part of everything. Everywhere space is there eternally. Similarly for the five human values there is only one basis. Love is that basis.  Love in speech is Truth. Love in action is Dharma or Righteousness. Love in thought is Peace. Love in understanding is Non violence. The fundamental basis of the four values i.e. truth, righteousness, peace and non-violence is love.
It is not worldly, material attachment. True love is spiritual and it is the love for God. Many times people keep telling very loosely “I love you, I love you.” They do not really understand true love. They are subjecting themselves to attachment. True love is love without expectations, without any desires. There may be the love between husband and wife, mother and children -any kind of relationship if there is no expectation it becomes love. Love alone can match love. Love is a perfect principle. 
That is complete, God is complete, this is complete, Creation is complete. After this Creation comes out of the complete, what remains is also complete. There are no perversions like waxing and waning. It is always complete and perfect.
All of you have gathered here in order to experience such complete and perfect love. Swami’s love is without any expectations. It is complete perfect and divine. Love lives by giving and forgiving, self lives by getting and forgetting. In this love of Swami, He knows only to give. He does not know how to receive and accept. Whenever Swami stretches His hand in order to receive, it is only for love.
All of you from many countries have come here because of this kind of relationship of love that exists between you and Swami. This divine love is a magnetic power. When you have such divine love the whole world will gather around you. When we develop such love there will be nothing lacking for us. It is My desire that every one of you will develop such love. If you really understand this principle of love, you need not study any scripture or Veda or Upanishad. Kabir Das has said you may study any number of scriptures; unless you understand the two-and-a half letter word prema, love, you will not understand anything.
As was stated in the drama yesterday the whole world is reflection, reaction, resound. When you give love you will get love. If you hate anybody you will get back hate. If you stand in front of a mirror and smile, the reflection also smiles at you. That is why I say the whole world is nothing but reflection. Whatever we do, we will definitely experience the consequences. When you love people selflessly, you will definitely get selfless love from everyone.
There are lot of people who ask such questions. “I love him but he does not love me. In spite of all my love he does not like me; he hates me.” If you make a subtle analysis of who is at fault, you are lacking in your love. You should not give up in the middle. You should understand your love is not enough to conquer them. When you feel you are loving him but he is not loving you, it means that you have to love him more and more.  When you continue to love in spite of whatever reaction, ultimately love will emerge in that person’s heart also.
I have seen during this Birthday celebrations all the children have devised many programmes out of great love for Swami. Also when I walk amidst you, I receive your love, enjoy your love, treasure your love. Love is My Form. My food is the bliss that emerges from love. As long as you feed me with the bliss that you experience out of selfless love, I will always be strong and I will not become weak. Many people ask me “How are you, Swami? How are you, Swami?” As long as you experience bliss out of selfless love, I will always remain strong, I will never become weak. Where am I? I am in your heart. When you love everyone from within your heart, in that heart Swami will establish and install Himself permanently. And He will always be happy and will never experience any sorrow. If one day we do not eat food, we will become weak, hungry and suffer. In the same way as food is very important for the strength of your body the bliss that you experience out of selfless love is very important for Me to be strong. If you really want Swami to be happy you should love everyone from your heart and I will consume that love and remain strong and happy. Because this love and bliss are My food. One day you behave with selfishness and hatred and criticise others, I will become weak on that day. Because you did not give Me My food. Every moment, every day you keep on loving others, then Sai who is Himself the embodiment of love will ever remain strong and happy.
In this sacred land of action we cannot escape action. Even a little boy will tell you there is reaction to every action. For every object there is a reflection. For every sound there is a resound. This world is full of reflection, reaction and resound. When you develop good qualities within yourself, you will know that all others are also good. And that is what gets reflected in others and that is what you see. If you want to get a lemon you have to sow a lemon seed not a neem. You sow one seed and expect to get another fruit, it is impossible. When you sow the seeds of love you will get the fruits of love. When you sow the seeds of sacrifice, you will get the fruits of sacrifice. We have to develop the noble qualities of love and sacrifice and sow the same seeds in the hearts of others around you.
Narasimhamurthy said it is a valedictory. This is not actually the valedictory; in fact, it is only the beginning. When you go back home to your countries whatever have learnt here you have to practice and propagate these things. You are carrying seeds in your hands. Only when you sow that seed in land, it can give you fruits. If you keep seeds in your hand and aspire for fruit, you will never get it. When you till the land, plant the seed, nourish it, finally you will get the tree which will yield you fruits.
Gopikas prayed to Krishna “In the loveless hearts of ours, sow the seeds of love, let the rivers of love flow and the trees and fruits of love come up  in our hearts.” Love is the seed, love is the land, love is the water; with all this finally you will get the fruit of love.
When you are going back home, you need not feel bad. You should never develop the fear that we were in the vicinity and proximity of Swami for so many days, enjoyed so much of divine bliss; we may lose it when we go back. 
Yesterday you saw in the drama also so many number of Sai Babas came out. I am one, I became many. I am there within each one of you. You take me to your countries, I will myself become many! I am as many as you are. 
It’s a big mistake on your part to think that you are leaving Swami behind and going back. You take Swami with you. Be with Swami yourself and Swami will be with you. You are always telling me “Swami, Be with me, be with me,” I also want to tell you the same thing “You be with Me.” If you are with me, I will be with you! Therefore take me to your country along with you; I will always be always with you – behind you, by your side and lead you.
When you contemplate on Me and enter into any activity all activities will succeed. Why do you face obstacles and difficulties? Just because we forget God at that moment. When you face difficulties and adversities, you think of God, that will be too late. As long as you are contemplating and thinking of Swami, you will never get into any sinful action. As long as we think that Swami is a witness to all that I think, do and speak, you will not get into the wrong. Only when you think Swami is somewhere else, you get into wrong actions. But as long as you believe that Swami is a witness to everything, you will not do things that Swami does not like.
 You do love Swami there is no doubt. But because Swami is in everyone, you have to love everyone. When you love Me and ridicule and criticise others, that is no love at all. When you love everyone then only you are loving Swami.  If you want to develop this kind of love, you should have great faith in Swami. “Swami will look after me; He will protect me in every situation. Whatever I require at any point of time, whichever place and how much is required, I will always get it. Therefore I need not worry about myself. I need not think of my selfish needs. I need not have to be afraid. I have to love and serve everyone. Whatever I require, Swami will give.”  When you have such firm faith, you can develop such selfless love. Where there is faith, there is love. Where there is love, there is truth.  Where there is truth, there is peace. In order to attain peace, first thing you have to attain is faith. Where there is faith, there is love. Wherever there is love, all the other human values like truth, righteousness, peace and non-violence will be there. Don’t give rise to any scope for fear. Where there is fear, there is no faith. Where there is faith, there is no fear. Therefore, give up fear and develop faith.
Swami has not gone anywhere. If you want a witness or a testimony for Swami being here, your being here is the testimony. If Swami is not with you for a moment, you cannot live in this world. Swami in the form of consciousness and energy is always in you; without Him you cannot live. As long as you live you know that Swami is there. Sai is the basis of your life. You have to make the basis firm by developing firm faith in Sai.
People talk about world peace but what efforts do they make? Many conferences happen but peace is not to be seen. Only when we develop love there can be peace. Therefore the theme for this World Youth Meet, I directed, is love and peace. Where there is love, there is peace. There is no scope for your hating anybody or ridiculing anybody. Love knows only love and nothing else. If any other feeling arises in our heart we should know that our love is not enough. Therefore you develop this love, take this principle of love of Swami everywhere and propagate it all over the world. When you develop such love, you will attain peace.
Sathya yuga has started no doubt but a person who sleeps even after sunrise there is no reward because he did not do the effort required during the day. In spite of the sunrise because he is sleeping, he thinks it is night. Whether Sathya yuga comes or not; that does not matter. You have to question ourselves whether we are behaving accordingly with Sathya yuga.  In this age of love, Prema yuga, we should develop that kind of love. 
Wherever you go, whichever country, Swami will always be with you, around you, behind you, in front of you. When you become dear to Me, you will be near to Me. You have to question yourself “How can I become dear to Swami?”  When I tell you something, you take it seriously and you have to put it into practice. Any student who follows the words of the teacher will be dear to the teacher. Such students will be near to teachers. 
That is why the Singapore people sang.......
I would also like to tell you “If you follow Me, I will follow you.”
Don’t walk ahead of Me, I may not follow; Don’t walk behind Me, I may not lead; Walk with me. Be My friend.
You have to go back with the determination that all of you will combine in unity, holding each other’s hand .....
My love and grace are there on every one of you. Put it to good use. There may be heavy downpour but if the vessel is kept upside down, you cannot fill the vessel.  My downpour of love is always happening. You have to keep the vessel of you love in the right way to collect it. Therefore I bless you with all My grace but you have to put it to good use.
In spite of all obstacles the.........
It did not happen only because of My will. When your effort joins My will it will happen. To clap you need both hands. To salute someone you need two hands. The current flows when there are both positive and negative. With My grace joins when your effort joins, you can find success. My Grace is always there; you should not be lacking in your effort. When effort and grace get together, you get success. Whatever be the effort required, you should be determined to achieve the experience of your own divinity. But giving up in the middle and going back is not the testimony of faith. Swami, if He wills anything, He will never give up in the middle, He is bound to achieve it. You should also be like that. You should not give up in the middle. As long as you think you want to experience your divinity, you have to put in your effort, not give up in the middle; you have to march ahead till you reach the goal. 
I am sending you back with the complete blessing that all of you will become divine, men and women of sacrifice, love and service. And because of your invitation I will visit every one of your countries.",11/23/2015,Special_Occasion,Sathya Sai Baba Birthday
37,Delhi Hospital Foundation Discourse 1,"Maharajji just now said that this is a yajnam. Yajna is termed as sacrifice; that which is with thyaaga alone is yajna. In the yajna there is oblation. What is this oblation or the sacrifice that we are doing here? The selfishness within us has to be put into this fire of wisdom. It is not leaving house and hearth that one has to go away and one becomes a true yogi; wherever you are if you give up the feelings of selfishness within, you become a yogi. 
Therefore, Swami does not expect big things from all of us. What Swami says is if everybody gets together, we can achieve anything. And the very first step Swami said is for three years we have been looking for building this hospital in Delhi. There are many devotees who are here; they have been supporting in a big way to do this hospital in Delhi, whom Swami had commanded. Like every child’s birth date and birth time is already pre-written and pre-destined, that’s how Swami’s every work has also got a certain time at which it happens. The time is right now; therefore, just like a baby is born at the right time, the hospital will be ready. Swami says that within one year, like every project of Swami, we would try and do the very first operation, absolutely free of all charges including residential charges and food for the children. We shall meet again on 26th of November next year here to do the first operation.
The first oblation to the fire is by Mr. Srinivas because when Swami said “I don’t know how but by 90th birthday it has to happen,” he went and mortgaged all his property – whatever he had from his parents – he mortgaged it and then he put all that money, he is working hard to get that. Swami says that he has put the seed, now the tree will grow; help will come from all parts of the world and the hospital will be ready within one year and operation will happen. 
He says, “My Blessings are there with all of you. Like Draupadi who tied a little piece of cloth on Krishna’s finger and saved it from bleeding and the same sari saved Draupadi in the time of her need; whoever has participated in whatever way, this help to the society  will help them in their times of need.” 
Swami is very happy that this has happened. We should meet again within the next one year. This will be ready and we will all come here to perform the very first operation and there onwards it will grow as an international institute of paediatric cardiac sciences with much research and other activities also happening apart from operations. 
Swami conveys His Blessings to all.

38,Christmas 2015 Discourse,"The whole of Creation has emerged from Truth. Ultimately the whole of Creation will merge back into the Truth. If you look for a place which is not impacted by Truth, you can never find it. This is the ultimate, perfect Purity. This is what you have to recognise. 

Embodiments of Divine Love!

The Creation which is born of Brahma, the Lord will ultimately manifest itself as Brahma or the Lord. The tree which is born of dust or soil will ultimately merge back into dust. But apparently it appears differently. This is the Truth that exists which I am telling you now. 

Today is a very sacred day of the Christmas festival. But only when we practise with sincerity the teachings of the Master and manifest it in our lives and demonstrate the ideal he set before mankind, only then we can find some fulfilment in our lives. What is the reason a human being, a man who was born in a very poor family and for thousands of years he is being adored and worshipped as God; if you ask the question how did it happen, it is because of  his quality of sacrifice. Not because just he was born on this day that we celebrate but because of the actions that he involved himself in and the ideals that he set for the world, we celebrate his birthday today.

On 25th of December, many people are born. This morning when I was having My lunch two boys came there because it was their birthday today in order to serve Me food. Just because two or three people are born on the same day, will all of them be alike? Just because we name ourselves Rama or Krishna or Buddha or Jesus, can we become themselves? Not at all! We may cleanse ourselves externally, physically. Unless we purify our inner being, our hearts, all the efforts will go waste. We can think that we have celebrated his birthday meaningfully only when we tread the path shown by him and manifest that ideal in our lives.

What did he really teach us? “All are one, my dear son! Be alike to everyone!” He taught the world the great truth that all are one. Only externally we are different beings, but internally there is only one being, only one Truth, one divinity. That is what he taught us. He loved everyone, he served everyone and ultimately gave up his body in search of the eternal ideal of welfare of mankind. He dedicated and offered all his life for achieving the welfare of the world.

At the time of his Last Supper, the previous day of his crucifixion, he said one thing to his disciples. In one hand he held a piece of bread, another hand a cup of wine and said, “This is not bread, this is my body, this is my flesh. This drink is not just a drink, it is my own blood.” That is what he said. Whenever any great and noble person utters anything, they will be pregnant with inner significance. Only if we understand the inner significance, we will be able to delve deep into that immortal teaching. “This body is not mine, this belongs to everyone. All bodies are mine. All the blood that flows in every being is my blood.” He taught the Truth that “I am in everyone and everyone is in me.”

Some of the youth who came here they came up with a plan for blood donation. I asked them, “Who created this body? Who created blood? Whose is the blood and to whom are you giving it? All the blood that flows in every being was created by one God. You may be a very great doctor or a physician but can you create a human body? You are utilising the body created by God, performing surgeries and becoming a great surgeon but you will never be able to create a body like this.
From the moment of birth till death, the heart is all the time beating and pumping blood; if you ask a simple question who is doing this, you can recognise the truth. All of you are sitting here and enjoying the programmes here. But did you wonder for one moment who is doing inhalation and exhalation of breath in your body? Did you ever ask yourself even once who is the one who is digesting the food that you eat for lunch? All these activities are being done by God and therefore the body is healthy; you are able to utilise this healthy body for pursuing your profession. 

What is not yours how can you think it is yours? This body is not mine; it is an instrument granted to me by God. The blood is not created by me; it is a liquid created by God. Therefore you have to ask yourself a subtle question, “To whom are you giving this blood?” You have to develop the sense of unity that you are donating blood to yourself. You should never use the word 'donation'. 'Donation' indicates a sense of duality that somebody is giving and somebody else is taking. There arises a feeling there somebody is who is giving and there is somebody else who is taking; it is a sense of duality. Not at all! There is only one divine principle. It is not donation, it is God who is sharing with God Himself. We have to do every act of service with the feeling that I am not serving anybody else, I am serving myself. Even when Jesus Christ was put on the cross, he prayed, “Forgive all of them, Lord! They know not what they are doing; they are acting in ignorance.” Even in his last moments of agony, if he could offer that prayer to God, you ask the question, you know that he knew that he was the one who was there in everyone. All the time he taught, demonstrated and lived the message that all are one. 

All of you are listening to this talk. Even if you don't involve yourself in anything else, at least donate your blood to your neighbour. It is good for you and good for the other one. If I had a physical body, I would have been the first to register for blood donation. But I don't have the physical body, but all your bodies are Mine. Therefore on My behalf all of you go there and register yourselves and give blood whenever, wherever required. Any good act we do, we do not know when it is going to come to our rescue in our difficult moments. A piece of sari which Draupadi made into a bandage for Krishna ultimately saved her from humiliation. Whatever acts of service we involve in we should have the feeling that we are serving ourselves and not develop pride or arrogance or ego thinking that I am serving somebody else.

Three years before when I commanded Srinivas to go to Raipur and establish a hospital, not even for a moment he thought or asked the question “How will I go that long distance and how will I establish a hospital?” He just thought “What I need to do in my life is to obey Swami's command.” He went that long distance and to a very unknown place and established this hospital and within a very short period, that hospital has won national honour. It is not an honour for us, it is an honour for this great country of Bharat signifying that such noble people are there even today in this land. 

All of you know you have come here from many nations of the world. But you go anywhere you will not find a free heart surgery hospital anywhere else in the world except Bharat. They may have a lot of money; they may have great power of intellect and also great money and wealth. But because of lack of devotion such a great act is not possible anywhere. When Srinivas went to that distant place, he did not have a single rupee in his pocket. But he had faith like that of a mountain. With that faith, he could achieve all this.

Not only that, when I commanded Narasimhamurthy that we have to establish many educational institutions, he never asked Me a question, “How can we do it? Where do we get the wherewithal to do it?” But because of the courage based on the faith “It is Swami who is telling me and Swami knows everything, Swami can do everything,” he went there.

Jesus Christ had only one Judas; I have many Judas'. But where there is love, there is no fear. When you are fearless, you can achieve anything. If you want to develop fearlessness, you need to cultivate faith. Swami has not gone anywhere, He is with us. He is there demonstrating our own divinity 	to manifest in our lives.	You  have to secure the faith that when we have the omnipotent Lord, our Swami, with us we can achieve anything. I can't tell you everything in detail but one thing I can tell you. Within a very short period, the kind of service activities we have undertaken are going to spread all over the country. Not only the country, to every nation and they are going to serve all mankind and provide them protection and nourishment. 

The teaching of Jesus Christ is being put into full meaning and significance by the kind of educational institutions and the healthcare institutions that his followers are establishing and running today all over the world. The whole world adores and reveres Jesus Christ because of the service activities undertaken by his followers. What the followers of Jesus Christ achieved in 2000 years, our followers, our devotees are going to achieve in the next twenty years. Within 20 years, My devotees, My followers are going to demonstrate to the world what is Sri Sathya Sai Baba and what is Sri Sathya Sai Baba's teaching. Therefore, you be ready in your thought, word and deed. It is not just enough you utter the word 'Swami, Swami' in your lips, it is not only enough if you contemplate on His name but through your hands, you have to demonstrate the acts of love and service.

Within the next year, we are starting an international centre for paediatric cardiac care. Such cardiac care centres will ultimately emerge in every corner of this country. After the Delhi centre, comes the Mumbai, then in Gujarat, then in Kolkata, and then in Orissa. We are going to provide this facility of free healthcare for all the children of India. Not only children of India, the children of the whole world. 
You are going to witness the programmes which will be staged by the children from Nigeria. For children with heart problem, it is very difficult – whether they are children in India to go to Nigeria or children in Nigeria and to come to India. And therefore, for the children of Africa, we are going to establish a small free healthcare centre in the ashram which is already established by Father Charles Ogada. All kinds of investigations required to find out the heart problems of the children in Nigeria, after doing that the children can either come to India or our surgeons can go to Nigeria and perform the surgeries.

Therefore, our own children should study well and many of them should become real surgeons. If you become good surgeons, you can join our hospitals and do any quantum of service. Today commerce has invaded all the educational institutions and the healthcare institutions; there is nothing called service in these institutions. Even if you want to do service, the management will tell you unless they pay up the charges, you cannot do anything. But in our hospitals, in our institutions, we are rendering service at all times round the clock. How are all these things happening? It is not just enough if there is Swami's Will; your effort, your attempt is also required. When both positive and negative get together, the current would flow. Only when we bring both our hands together, we can offer salute to anybody. With one hand, you can only ridicule somebody, you can't respect anyone. When God's Grace and His Will and human effort get together, you can achieve anything.

There is no need for us to enter into arguments “Where is Sai Baba? Sai Baba is here, Sai Baba is there, Sai Baba is not here, not there.” Whether you accept it or not, whether you speak about it or not, I pervade every atom of the universe. But if you want to experience My all pervasiveness and omnipresence, the only way is you have to purify your heart and sanctify your lives with love and service. That is what Lord Jesus also referred to – a pure, sacred heart. The kingdom of heaven is within you, within your heart; it is not elsewhere. This body given by God, when we utilise it for the service of fellow beings, only then we can experience the heaven within our own hearts. You should never develop a sense of difference that only these people belong to me, others don't belong to me.

My Christmas message today is the best way to serve God is to love all and serve all. Only when you love all and serve all, you truly love Swami and serve Him. It is written there. It is not enough if it is written on the wall, it should be written on your hearts. It is not enough to have it in your heart, through your hands you have to demonstrate it. 

I conclude My Discourse aspiring and blessing all of you that all of you will develop a pure heart and lead a sanctified life of love and service.

39,Evening Satsang,"What is the meaning of saying that God comes down as in a divine incarnation? 	With love and compassion for the whole of mankind, God comes down to their level on this earth along with both individual consciousness and divine consciousness. 

Embodiments of Divine Love!

To think that God is in one place, He comes from somewhere and goes somewhere, is full of ignorance. When you watch a film on a screen, you may see many interesting and colourful things happening on the screen, many things coming and many things going, but the screen which is the basis remains permanent always. Because of the screen only, we are able to see all things happening in the story. The pictures are moving about, the shadows are moving about, but the screen remains permanent and steady in one place. For all moving pictures and shadows, the immovable screen is the basis. But when you are watching the film, you will never be able to see with your eye the screen. Only when the film – the projection of the film – stops, you can recognise that the screen exists. On the road, we find many kinds of vehicles moving. For all the moving vehicles, the immovable road is the basis. The road is steady but the vehicles are moving. For every moving vehicle, the immovable road is the basis. We only look at the vehicle and not at the road. But when you stop the vehicle and get down, you know that you are standing on the road. Similarly for everything in life there is some basis – firm basis, steady basis. But if you want to see the immovable, the steady basis of everything in Creation, first thing we have to stop  the movement of the shadows in the world. The same thing I told devotees this morning.

The boat can stay in water. But water should not be allowed to get into the boat. It is good enough that we are born in this world; but if the world enters our life then everything is ruined. You may be in the world but do not allow world to get into you. If boat is floating on water, it is no harm; in fact, the water is helping the boat. But the same water which helps the boat to move, if it gets into the boat, it will become dangerous. We may live in the world but we should not allow the world to enter into us. In order to see that the world does not enter us, it is necessary we realise the fact that all things that happen in the world are temporary and they are of no consequence. All the things in the world come and go, that is why the world is called 'Jagath'. 'Ja' means go, 'gath' means come. This coming and going is a part of our life in the world. But for all life in the world, the permanent basis is Jagadeesha, Lord of the world, who is the permanently, steadily always there. When you stop projecting the film on the screen, then you see that it is the screen which is the basis for the film. If we fill our mind with all that is selfish and self-interest,  we will never be able to see the absolutely selfless basis of the world that is God.

In order to tell whole of mankind this Truth, God comes down as a Prophet or a Messiah or a teacher to teach this to everyone. Jesus first came as a Messiah, as a messenger. He came to propagate the message of God which was given to him to the world. But he started his mission with a feeling of duality that “I have a Master that is God; I am His messenger.” Because he practised everything that the Master told him, in some time he could find out that there is not much difference between the Master and myself. That is what is said in the scriptures that ''One who knows God becomes God Himself.'' And when we follow the words of God, it so happens gradually the divinity will enter into us. Therefore he could develop the feeling “I am not somebody who is distant from God; I am a part and parcel of God.” He also recognised the fact there is some inseparable relationship between God and me. He could recognise the Truth because he did not only speak out what he heard from God, but he practised whatever was told by God. Not by exhibition, but only by example he demonstrated the Truth of God to the world. Not that he just said 'Love All', but he loved all. Not only that he told that you should serve everybody, he himself served everybody. Through his sacredness and purity, he demonstrated this ideal to the world. When he was setting an example for everybody and demonstrating through the example, there were changes in his inner psyche. Because of these changes, he recognised the truth that “I am the son of God.” There is not much difference between me and my Father. As time passed by, he practised everything; not just by precept he came to know that he was one with God.

After the age of 12, Jesus moved around and met many Masters and learnt lot of wisdom from these Masters. Another 12 years he went around roaming in deserts, forests, towns and then he learnt lot of wisdom. And he came back to Jerusalem after 24 years of age. He entered the Temple of Jerusalem. He saw that the whole atmosphere in the temple was polluted. Everybody was involving himself or herself in commerce and business and nobody was interested in devotion and liberation. He was so sad looking that the House of God had become a house of business and he went on telling everybody that this should not happen. The priests were very angry that a young man comes and teaches them. And when the Chief Priest questioned him “We are the people who are running this place. We are most important. Who are you?” he said, “I am the son of God.” When he was asked the question again, “How do you say you are the son of God?” he said, “To think just because I am born of a father that I am the son of that father is wrong. I became the real son because I practised the precepts that were given to me by my Father. Through practise I could recognise the Truth that I am son of God.” Finally when he was crucified, in spite of all the agony and pain, he prayed that God should forgive everyone. When he developed that kind of compassion and forgiveness, he recognised the Truth that he was one with God.

When he was born, he called himself the messenger. When he demonstrated the teachings of God in his life, then he could understand that he was the  the son of God. And finally he said “I and my Father are one.” In Indian culture this has been explained in very simple terms as three schools of philosophy – Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita and Advaita. In 'Dvaita' there is a duality that “I have a Master, I am the servant.” When the son practises the teachings given by Father and also serves the Father, he will recognise the truth that he is a 'Jeevatma', a part and parcel of God Himself. The ultimate reward for complete practice of the teachings is that you will experience oneness and unity with God.

Similarly when Rama questioned Hanuman, he also explained the three aspects that 'I am a servant' first; then 'I am Jeevatma', or a part and parcel; and finally oneness with Rama Himself. When I have the feeling that I am the body, I am your servant. When I know the spark of divinity within my heart, I became a part and parcel of Yourself. When I realise the ultimate Truth “I and You are one.”  Hanuman thought when he was the body, he was the messenger or servant of God. When he recognised the truth that 'I am not just the body but I also have a mind', then he recognised that he was a part and parcel of God. And ultimately he realised the truth that “I and my Father are one.”

A river keeps flowing. You take a pot, fill the pot with water and get it home. The river water is there in this pot also. And you put the water from the pot into a tumbler and drink it. When you put the water into the tumbler, it takes a different shape. But the water in the tumbler or the pot or the river is the same. When you keep it in the tumbler, you call it tumbler water; when you have the body consciousness, you may get the feeling “I am like a tumbler and God is different.” But where did the water come from? From the pot only it got into this tumbler. There is the pot which is the mind. The mind makes you tell “I am a part of God, I am not God.” When you put back the water from the pot into the ocean, you find that there is only one water. That is the atmabhava, the realisation of the Self. To think that I am different from God because of our body consciousness is a kind of ignorance. 

You are not one but three: what  you think you are; what others think you are; what you really are. You think you are the body. It has a name, it has a form. You think that that is the truth, the whole Truth. You think that you identify yourself with the reflection in the mirror. You think that this is my name, this is my form. That is all body consciousness. When you sleep, where does the body go? You are not aware even whether body exists or not in your sleep. The mind would be roaming all around the world. Mind is doing all kinds of activities. It meets many people and talks to them. The body is not conscious but the mind is always conscious. The mind develops in us the feeling of individual soul. The mind has ego and attachment. The body may be killed but mind can never be killed. The mind goes from one body to another and keeps on going from body to body. This mind is the second part of the human personality. When the mind enters a female body, it thinks that it is a woman. “I am a girl.” The same individual soul, when it enters a male body, it thinks that “I am a man.” That is how it behaves. The mind has that ego sense or the individual sense. When you merge the mind ultimately, it becomes God Himself. That is like putting the water back from the pot into the river. God has given you the mind. That is why you are having the sense of duality. Mind is nothing but a bundle of desires. If you remove one desire after the other, ultimately mind will die. Man minus desire becomes God. When you merge the mind into God, you know that you are not the body, you are not the mind, you are God Himself. Mind is very important for us; we have to merge this in God. Matter is this body. Mind is the 'manas'. When the matter and mind merge in God, you know that you are God. The most essential thing to realise this truth is to make our mind very pure and sacred.

Narasimhamurthy said that Master is behind the curtain. What is that curtain? Curtain is also a cloth. That is also an illusion. This curtain has vertical and horizontal threads. All these are desires. If you remove all the threads one by one, the curtain will vanish. Then you can find the God who is behind the curtain. This experience is possible only for those who get rid of ego and attachment. When Jesus was ultimately crucified, he had the feeling that I am just the  son of God, but when he developed the broadness of forgiveness for everybody even those who crucified him, he himself became God. First he also cried out, “Why God, why you have forsaken me, why are you punishing me; but ultimately when he forgave everyone, he himself became God. Love lives by giving and forgiving. Love is God, God is love. Live in love.

Only when you recognise this truth, you will be one with God. Therefore, My dears, you have to love everybody. The Christmas festival is not just coming, cutting the cake, eating food – that is not Christmas festival. Only when we demonstrate in our lives the teaching of Jesus Christ, that becomes truly Christmas. We have to crucify our ego and attachment and get rid of them. You have to give up the body sense and the mind sense and have only the divine sense. And after having experienced the ultimate truth, he made a statement “All are one, my dear son. Be alike to everyone.” He said that all are one. That is the truth he taught. 

Many people question how Swami is able to love everybody; why we are not able to do it? Really to tell you the truth I don't love anybody or serve anybody thinking that I am loving somebody else. I do it because I love Myself and I serve Myself. Since I pervade every being, I know that I am there in everyone. That is why I love everyone. I don't know any sense of difference.  I see only Myself in everyone. Therefore spontaneously I am able to love everyone. All of you would aspire to love everybody but unless you know this Truth, you will never be able to do it. To know the truth, you have to get rid of your ego and attachments. 

I am very happy that all of you came, sang, celebrated and you are all blissful. I am very happy about it. What is the reason we worship Jesus Christ as God even today? His followers practised his teachings of selfless love and selfless service. That is why world is able to recognise the divinity of their Master. You want to propagate the divinity of your Master? First and foremost you should know your own divinity. Follow the Master, face the devil, fight till the end, finish the game. The first step is to follow the Master. There are the footprints of the Master – love and service. If you walk in the footsteps of the Master of love and service, you can easily reach the Master. However great a master may be if the students don't work hard, they will not learn anything. When there is a good teacher and good students, you can learn quite a lot. You should become good followers, good students. From this Christmas onwards, you should take at least one teaching of Swami and persist in practising that truth. You should never give up however difficult it might be. You should not stop in the middle and go away. You practise only one thing; it has everything in it. If you want to experience Me, you can experience wherever you are; first, you have to practise. 

Will all of you practise? At least one you have to practise. Just practise one teaching; it is enough.

40,2016 New Year's Day Discourse,"If you lose your wealth, it is possible you can regain it someday. If you lose a friend, it is possible that you may get him back on one day. If you lose your wife also it is possible you can get her back later. If you lose your land, it is possible you can get back the land. But once you lose this body, you can never ever get it back.
Embodiments of Divine Love!
The body is the basis of all righteous activity. If we do not have this body, there is no way we can do any action. God has gifted this human body to us with the only purpose that we walk on the path of righteousness. If you ask the question what is the goal of every human being, the answer is it is to experience one’s own divinity which is within, enjoy the bliss and make the whole life divine.
A few days before we saw here lot of people from Nigeria – children, elders- and they were brought here by Father Charles Ogada. Charles Ogada is a man of great devotion, great love and a man of service who has been bringing up Swami’s children in his ashram with great love. Once he was driving a car and there were two boys travelling with him in the car. He asked one of the boys a question which is normally asked to boys, “What do you want to become? When you grow up what do you want to become? Tell me.”  When this question is asked to ask young boys or girls they would reply, “I want to become an engineer; I want to become a doctor; I would like to become a professor.” This is what Charles Ogada also expected the boy would answer that he would like to become an engineer or a doctor or a professor. If you listen to the reply given by that boy to Charles Ogada, I can say even grown-up people do not have that kind of sincerity or purpose in life. He did not say “I want to become a doctor; I want to become a very rich person.” He said, “I want to become Jesus.” Such a small boy at that young age has the aspiration that he would like to become God. When young people have such aspirations, one day or the other they will achieve divinity. 
That is why I keep telling My students again and again “Start Early, Drive Slowly, Reach Safely.” When you are young if you do not tread the path of nobility and spirituality, when you grow up at no point of time you will be able to achieve it.  All of us know that in our gardens we plant young saplings. We also tie a straight stick to a very young sapling so that it grows straight upwards. If you don’t do it by tying a stick, it would grow in a curved way or a crooked way and when it grows up, it will be very ugly to look at. After it grows up however much effort we put we cannot straighten it.
When the mind and heart are very tender when you are young, if you can practise some of the ideals of spirituality, when you grow up it is easy for you to reach your goals. And normally what happens to us that when some thought that we should do something good comes in to our mind, we keep on postponing; but when wrong thought comes, we do it immediately. When you get a bad feeling, you implement into action immediately whereas when a good feeling comes, you keep on postponing that good action. Because of this postponement it so happens that your life-span finally becomes less and less and vanishes and in one moment, your life is taken away.
Once it happened one young boy was listening to an exposition of Ramayana in a meeting like this. This young boy was enjoying listening to the stories of Rama and Sita and their great and inspiring, exalting characters. The father searched for him in his home and he could not find him and finally he also came to the satsang where the boy was. When he looked for his son, he found him in the first line in the satsang and he with great sincerity, was lost in listening to the exposition on Ramayana.  He thought if he is going to sit here like this and listen to Ramayana, naturally he would become a sanyasi or a hermit; better I take him away from here. When father came and was pulling him away from the satsang, the great soul who was giving the lectures on the Ramayana asked his father, “It is so unjust that when the boy is so much interested you are taking him away from here.” “If this boy continues to listen to Ramayana and Bhagavatha, he is going to become a sanyasi.” But he asked his father, “You have been listening to Ramayana and Bhagavatha for so many years, have you become a sanyasi? You just listen through one ear and give it out through the other ear.” 
There is no use of listening to talks in such satsangs. What you listen, you have to contemplate on it and finally practise it in your life; then only the teaching finds fulfilment. If we just spend all our life, finally we will not be able to achieve anything. When you are a boy, you are interested in games and sports. When you have become a young man, you are interested in sensual pleasures. When you have become old, you are always immersed in worries. Nobody is interested in God.
The children have a natural urge in them to know about God and the path of spirituality. It is the duty of the elders that you should encourage them to enquire into spirituality and also clear their doubts. When they ask any question you have to answer very patiently giving them simple examples which they can understand and also telling them stories which justify your answer. When a young boy or a young girl approaches you asking a question, you should never say, “I don’t have time now. You go away now. Let me see later.”  Why do the elders do that? The real reason is that they don’t know the answers to the question being asked; that is why they say that. If the elders do not contemplate and practise the truths then naturally they will not be able to answer the questions asked by the young people. The elders keep postponing good practices.
There was a person sitting at home, it was raining. The roof was leaking; therefore, all the rain was coming down into the house. He was facing great difficulty but he found a corner where it was not leaking and spent his time there. The neighbours came and advised him “Why are you simply undergoing this difficulty? Is it not right for you to repair the roof?” “The rainy season has come in. Now I don’t have any opportunity to repair the roof. After the rains are over, I will do that.” Rainy season was over and there were no rains. The neighbours came and told him, “Now that the rains are over, why not you repair the roof?” But this gentleman being a miser told him, “When there is no rain, there is no leakage. Why should I repair the roof?” When it is raining you don’t repair it because you cannot repair it in the rain. When there is no rain, you don’t want to repair it because the water is not leaking. This is because he did not have the sincerity of purpose or shraddha.
One who is sincere will always attain wisdom. If you are sincere in your aspiration that you want to attain God and lead a divine and blissful life, naturally you will pursue the path. Wherever there is shraddha or sincerity of purpose, there there is good practice. When there is no sincerity, you will not put anything into practice. New year comes, year rolls by; another new year comes, the years keep rolling by. If you do not have sincerity in your approach, you will never achieve anything.
 One day or the other you will lose everything and there is nothing that you are going to attain. Don’t be proud of your wealth, youth and human support. In one minute, everything can be taken away by death. Whatever we have done in the past is already done and in future we do not know what we are going to do; both are not important but the present is very important. You have got the human birth, you have got the human body; you should also develop desire for liberation. Even the shelter with a great Master has also come to you. When we have such wonderful opportunities, it is our duty to see that we put every opportunity to good use. It is not right for you to keep on postponing doing the right things. If you want to get out of the cycle of birth and death, the only way is you have to experience your divinity. Till then you cannot escape from the cycle of birth and death. 
You are always telling each other ‘Happy New Year, Happy New Year!” What is true happiness? When you get good marks in your examination, it will give you some happiness. When you do some good deed, people come and praise you; for some time you are very happy. May be you will get some award or prize then you will be happy for some time. This happiness stays with you for a very short time; it won’t be there permanently. If you want permanent happiness, true happiness is union with God. If you want to celebrate New Year in the right way, you have to achieve this unity with God.  Don’t brood over the past; past is past. Future is not known. Present is omnipresent. Better we forget our past, what we did in the past; now do what we are required to do in the present. When you take care of the present, future will take care of itself.  
If you want to be really happy, blissful and divine, follow Swami’s ideal in your life. We have to follow what Swami is telling us: love everybody, serve everybody, get rid of ego and attachments and be happy. If Swami is with us, what else do we need? Nothing is required for us. He will give me whatever I require at any point of time. I need not have to struggle or worry about it. I will have to just do my work; that’s all. He will give me everything. When you develop that kind of a devotion like that of a kitten to its mother cat, then Swami will definitely look after everything for you. You should develop firm faith. When you offer everything to Swami knowing fully well, believing that He is going to look after everything, definitely Swami will look after everything. Only when you have such complete faith, it is possible you will develop that kind of self-surrender. Swami is running everything; He is in fact running my life also.
Previously when I was in Puttaparthi, if you wanted to go to Dharmavaram or any other place, you had to take a horse-carriage. Taxis were not there and buses were very rare. They would sit in the horse carriage and travel to Dharmavaram railway station. The driver of the horse coach was very harsh with the horse and troubling the horse. He is beating the horse so that it will drag the carriage faster so that they will reach the railway station. For a long time the horse heard everything, bore everything. As long as he was only scolding it, it was going forward. Then there was a voice heard from the sky. “You are beating up the horse and also you are pulling the reins very hard. Don’t do it. It will go faster.” The voice from the sky told him, “Don’t hold the reins so tight. Loosen them and the horse will go faster.” The horse coach driver asked, “Who is that who is teaching me this?” Then the horse said, “This is the voice of Krishna. He was the charioteer of Arjuna. He was looking after four horses, not one horse.” The horse told him, “You do what Krishna is telling you; then I will be able to run faster.” But the driver said, “Krishna knew about his four horses but he does not know about you. Therefore, I will run you. I will take you the way I want. I will do what I want to do with you. How does Krishna know about you?” The omnipotent Krishna, does he not know about this horse? It is because of his narrow-mindedness, he was behaving in that way.
When Swami is looking after everybody in this whole universe, can He not look after your life? But if you take the reins of your life into your own hands, there is nothing I can do. When you offer the reins of your life to Swami and tell Him, “Swami, I offer it to You; you only look after me,” then He will definitely look after you. If a car has two drivers it is very dangerous. If there is a good driver, the travel will become comfortable. That is why we say, “Less luggage, more comfort; it makes travel a pleasure.”  Be happy; offer everything to Swami. Swami will definitely take you forward in your life.
When you talk about New Year, New Year is an event in the calendar but if you see truly every moment that comes is a new year. Therefore every moment we should put it to good use, get rid of ego and attachment, experience our own divinity and be blissful and become divine.
I aspire and bless all of you that every one of you will develop that kind of sincerity on the path and practise it; with this I bring the discourse to a close.",1/1/2016,Special_Occasion,New Year's Day
